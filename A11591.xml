            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the Epiſtles to this Church it is obſeruable, that the Apoſtle prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his name: without any Title of dignitie or office. In
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17313:6"/> others, dignifies his perſon with ſome Title of reſpect: an Apoſtle, or a Seruant of God, or both. Interpreters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire reaſon of it, and thus reſolue. Some impute it to his modeſtie, and deſire to winne his Aſſociates ſome equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of reſpect: ſome to his prudence, and care to auoid ſcandall, that might ariſe amongſt Nouices, from ſhew of arrogancie: ſome to this, that perhaps they were not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with falſe apoſtles, as other Churches, amongſt whom he needed to auow his calling: whether one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not much materiall to inquire: neither occurres any thing of ſpeciall notice, except this, That <hi>it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lawfull for a Miniſter, to vſe thoſe Titles of honour and reuerence, wherewith God hath graced him; ſometimes more conuenient the aſſuming ſhould be forborne.</hi> PAVL, where he ſees the authoritie and fruit of his Miniſterie, hazarded by denyall of his Titles, inſiſts largely in auowing of them; as to<note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.</note> Corinthians, and Galatians; and where he ſees concealement more conuenient to auoid ſhew of vaine glorie, he omits them.</p>
            <p>The like is requiſite for vs. There are people ſo idlely affected with Titles of dignitie, that the ſame Truth hath more or leſſe authoritie with them, according to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of perſons, in theſe reſpects, that propound it. There are men of another ſtraine, ſo vtterly diſtaſting all Titles in a Miniſter, that the mention of them, on any occaſion, is cenſured of vaine glorie, and the doctrine it ſelfe ſo much the leſſe regarded. It is ſome part of a Miniſters prudence, in theſe trifles to ſee, what is moſt conuenient for the peoples edification. Miniſters I haue knowne of reuerend parts for learning and conſcience, whoſe whole Miniſterie hath beene therefore deſpicable amongſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diotes, becauſe nor Birth, nor Vniuerſitie degrees haue commended them to the world; ſo idlely are ſilly people carryed away with trifles: yet when gold is offered them, their care is not great how baſe the perſon is that brings it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He matter of the Epiſtle now followes. It is ſpent partly in commendation of this people; chiefly in exhortation: firſt, to perſeuerance in the faith and grace recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Secondly, to progreſſe and going forward to perfection.</p>
               <p>The three firſt Chapters perſwade continuance; the two latter progreſſe in Grace; ſome other particulars are incidentally touched, but theſe are the chiefe bent of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>The mayne incentiue to perſeuerance inſinuated in this Chapter, is, the conſideration of the rich Grace of God, beſtowed on them by the Apoſtles miniſterie, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fame thereof in the Churches of God; from both which forcibly is inferred the neceſſitie of their care to maintayne their ſtation; ſith they could not be ignorant, how much <hi>more deſperate</hi> the caſe is,<note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</note>

               <p>To this Argument, the Apoſtle prefaceth with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God, the ſole Authour of all Graces that they had receyued; profeſſing alſo his inſtance in prayer for their eſtabliſhment and profection in grace; to this end, that they might neither be puffed vp with ſelfe-conceit, by his ample commendation; nor forget, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation &amp; perfiting in grace, was to be expected from that<note n="f" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10.</note> God of all grace,<note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>In the words we haue two things; firſt, <hi>Pauls</hi> offices and acts of loue performed on their behalfe: thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and prayer to God.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17313:13"/> from the diſtinction of Iudgement, of certaintie, and Charitie, ſcoffed at by this man; yet in ſubſtance all one. Of perſwaſion in this kinde there are two degrees: the one infallible, the other morall or coniecturall. Infallibly, except by ſpeciall Reuelation, as<note n="k" place="margin">

Charitable or coniecturall, that wherein it is poſſible to erre and be deceiued. In both kinds wee muſt remember to diſcerne betwixt the thing whereof the certaintie is, and the certaintie it ſelfe. The thing whereof the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie is, is the Propoſition whereto the Aſſent is giuen. The certaintie, the Aſſent it ſelfe. Neceſſarily muſt theſe be diſtinguiſhed: for it is poſſible to be vndoubtfully and fully perſwaded euen of what is falſe: as <hi>Paul</hi> was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtfully <hi>perſwaded,</hi> that he<note n="l" place="margin">

               <p>Of whether ſort was <hi>Pauls</hi> iudgement here profeſſed? Of infallibilitie, ſaith the vpſtart Prophet <hi>Traske;</hi> and thence is his collection: That one may know anothers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or that one that is the Child of God, may infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly know the regeneration of another: of whom, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire firſt to know the quantity of his Concluſion, whether

I purpoſe not to quarrell about his making election and regeneration all one; I will take his latter clauſe, as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or explanation of the former; that his meaning ſhall be; the Elect, not before regeneration, but after, may know, the election of others, namely, after they are once effectually called: meanes hee all the Regenerate or ſome?</p>
               <p>Certainly his reaſons conclude as well for all, as ſome: as well for weake Nouices, while they are weake, as for ſtronger men, that haue receiued his Spirit of diſcerning: euen theſe, be they neuer ſo weake, are <hi>ſubiects of one Kingdome: Citizens of one Citie: Children of one Father: Seruants of one Houſhold: Members of one Body:</hi> or if there be any other ſimilitude, more liuely expreſſing our neere coniunction in the body of Chriſt; as well agree they to Babes in Chriſt, as to ſtronger men: like ſay wee of the Commandements, <hi>To put difference, to loue the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that his giddie diſciples need no longer hang on him as their Oracle, to know their election; for any Nouice in his Schoole, may as fully reueale to them, that their <hi>names are written in the booke of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truth is, it is neither generally, nor particularly true; but vniuerſally falſe; that any man, without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie reuelation, knowes the election of another.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17313:18"/> abſurd. This is mine Apologie. Euen his ſpeech, they ſay, frets like a Gangreene, and increaſeth to more vngodlineſſe, in that giddy multitude, whoſe ſtile it will euer be; to be conſtant <hi>in leuitate ſua.</hi> Such Whirligigge Weather-cocke braines there are amongſt them, ſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh in vnderſtanding, that they are wherryed about with euery blaſt of vaine doctrine.

Laſtly, who knowes whether God may bee pleaſed to giue him repentance and ſight of his errour by this meanes, before hee be too farre intangled in the ſnare of the Deuill?</p>
               <p>Our concluſion is this: <hi>No man, except by extraordinary reuelation, can infallibly know the Election or Regeneration of another.</hi> Our Reaſons theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The meane wee muſt follow in iudging of other mens election is not infallible. Therefore our knowledge cannot bee infallible. The <hi>medium</hi> whence wee gather, whatſoeuer good opinion or perſwaſion of others, is, their actions materially good, their conuerſation out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly holy, their hearts, I trow, wee ſhall leaue to him, that ſtiles himſelfe the <hi>Lord that</hi>

                  <hi>ſearcheth the hearts and tryeth the reines.</hi> If then the Acts of ſanctitie be all wee iudge by, how may wee call our iudgement infallible; there being no act that can poſſibly runne into our ſenſe, but may proceede from a man of the holloweſt heart?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Infallible knowledge of Regeneration preſuppoſeth as infallible knowledge of the Motiues, Grounds, Intentions of the actions of obedience, in the performers: Theſe being the principall differences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Regenerate mens actions, from their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits in Hypocrites and Ciuilians. Suppoſe thus; To
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17313:18"/> acts of Righteouſneſſe can be concluded to iſſue out of a ſanctified heart, that flow not from<note n="m" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</note>

               </q>
               <p>Thirdly, To know our owne Election and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is difficult: therefore to know other mens impoſſible;<note n="o" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure;</hi> It is a taske of much toyle and paines; ſuch diligence elſe had not beene enioyned by the Apoſtle,<note n="p" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Prooue your ſelues whether you be in the faith; examine your owne ſelues;</hi> hee doubles the exhortation to intimate, that its not a ſingle ſearch will ſerue to procure aſſurance: and weigh but theſe Reaſons: Firſt, our willingneſſe to bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and flatter our ſelues, in nothing more, then in our ſpirituall eſtate. Secondly, the ſmall meaſure of Grace comparatiuely to the maſſe of corruption dwelling in our members. Thirdly, that counterfets of ſauing Grace approching ſo neere the nature of it. As to diſcerne a graine of Muſtard ſeed in a heape of chaffe, or in a maſſe of other ſeeds neere of kin vnto it, ſo difficult is it to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne grace in our owne hearts. Fourthly, the whole bodie of ſinne muſt be mortified, euery member of the old man mortified in a meaſure.<note n="q" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 8, 9</note> All graces accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ſaluation in their number, though not in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, complete, muſt be had, and diſcerned to be had of him that will be ſure of his Election and Calling. Fiftly, to which if we adde conſideration of our partiall decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, frequent interruptions of the exerciſe of Gifts receiued, the ebbing and flowing of Grace in our hearts, together with the experience of all Gods Children, that are truely ſuch: wee ſhall ſee it is no idle mans imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17313:19"/> to procure and maintaine aſſurance of his owne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. And ſhall we thinke it ſo eaſie to diſcerne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans? The taske is eaſie, if Maſter <hi>Traske</hi> ſay true; permit we our ſelues to the inſpection of him or his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we ſhall preſently attaine that aſſurance, that with ſo many ſighes and grones, and ſtrong cryes and teares, we ſcarce at laſt procure in any meaſure of infallibiltie or vndoubtfull certaintie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider the manner of aſcending to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Election and Saluation, wherein I may iuſtly ſuſpect, theſe men are yet vncatechized, the concluſion will eaſily appeare. It is by diſcourſe; the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of GODS Spirit layes downe in Scripture in generall Propoſitions. The aſſumption is made by our owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits aſſiſted and ſanctified by the Spirit of God: Suppoſe thus:<note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>They that are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt.</hi> I am led by the Spirit of God: I therefore a Childe of God and Heire of Saluation, in like ſort. <hi>Chriſt is</hi>

               <p>The propoſition we are aſſured of <hi>certitudine fidei,</hi> the aſſumption, only <hi>certitudine experientiae,</hi> out of that taſte we haue had of Gods goodneſſe, and experience of his Spirits power in ſanctfying vs. Can I feele, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally know the impreſſions of Gods Spirit on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans heart? taſte I the ſweetneſſe another feeles in Gods infuſion of his loue into his heart, by the Holy Ghoſt giuen vnto him? Is my Conſcience witneſſe of GODS wayes to another mans ſoule, or of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of another mans heart? If not, where is mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible knowledge of another mans Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? That<note n="t" place="margin">

               <p>Fiftly, I would now tell him out of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> how<note n="u" place="margin">

                  <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull the heart of man is aboue all things; who can know it?</hi> but that hee hath foreſtalled mee; profeſſing that in this iudgement he hath not to do with the heart, but with the Spirit that ſanctifieth the heart. But, Good Sir, will you diſcerne ſo infallibly the Spirit ſanctifying the heart, and not ſee the heart he ſanctifieth? <hi>fidem tuam.</hi> No, that is not the meaning; But this knowledge hee receiueth not from mens hearts; but from the Spirit that ſearcheth the hearts and tryes the reines. From the Spirit? I demand ſpeaking to him in the Word, or by ſecret inſpiration? <hi>Non redoles, ſed oles.</hi> I aſſure you, you ſmell ſtrongly of the Euthuſiaſme of Anabaptiſts &amp; Familiſts, the fathers of your Faction.

               <p>Of that of Charitie only, was and is my reſolution: The Reaſons theſe: The certainty and firmeneſſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion expreſſed in the terme of knowledge, he extends to all in this Church of Theſſalonica: for for them all he giues thankes, <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. And was his perſwaſion ſo infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible of all in this Church?

Of very Nouices and Babes in Chriſt, expecting like ſtrength of grace, the ſame meaſure of reformation, and zealous practice, that they profeſſe to feele in themſelues; otherwiſe growing not ſuſpicious only, but peremptorie, that they haue nothing in them ſauouring of ſinceritie: except ſinnes ſtrengthened by longeſt cuſtome, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently caſt off; if but in particulars they bewray infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; all other holineſſe and gracious practice is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only, and hypocriticall.

               <p>It ſhall behooue vs, as many as deſire to make our Calling and Election ſure to our ſelues, to inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this degree we haue felt the Word of God power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our ſoules.

Can wee thereout aſſume; that we are ſanctified? the concluſion will follow firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore we are elected. The maine difficultie ſtands in diſcerning our Sanctification; And is made ſo much the greater, by things ſo like and ſo neere of kinne vnto it, that without exact skill it is hard to cut a difference. Two things there are eſpecially, <hi>Cognatae ſanctitati.</hi> Firſt, is Ciuilitie, or as we commonly terme it, ciuill honeſtie: The ſecond, Grace reſtrayning. It may bee they differ only as the cauſe and the effect; Ciuilitie, as ſome thinke, being the fruit of reſtrayning Grace: let vs yet diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquire of them, and their difference from true San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie.</p>
               <p>Betwixt Ciuilitie and Sanctification obſerue theſe differences.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Ciuilitie is oft wrought by meere morall educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to naturall principles, without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or ſo much as deſire to bee acquainted with the Word of God. So ſee wee many, following that rule of the Law of Nature; <hi>What thou wouldſt not haue done to thee, doe not thou to others,</hi> carefull of common honeſtie in matters of contract and traffique with men, liuing in obedience to Ciuill Lawes, reſtrayned from Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Whoredome, and the like Enormities; though vtterly vnacquainted with the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Sanctification, though it incline to carefull obſeruance of the ſame duties, yet not by <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Morall Precepts, but by<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>the Word of God.</hi> And this wee may boldly ſay, A ciuill Chriſtian obſeruing theſe duties without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17313:25"/> of their Iniunction in the Word of God; is as farre from Sanctification as were Heathen Moraliſts; ſith they alſo out of ſome grounds performed like duties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If vſually it is obſeruable: Ciuilitie ſtayes, if not onely, yet principally in duties of the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: where the light of Nature is cleereſt. For matters of Pietie, if any bee obſerued, it is but ceremoniouſly, and ſo farre as they tend to preſerue credit and eſteeme of moderate men, in thoſe ſocieties whereof they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>

                  <hi>vnto God the things that are Gods, as vnto</hi> CaeSAR, and Neighbour what belongs vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ciuilitie ſtayeth for moſt part in Negatiues, in abſtinence from euill, thinkes it Charitie enough, not to impaire the wealth of the Neighbour; though his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate be not ſupported by any worke of Liberalitie and Mercie.</p>
               <p>In Religion, ſufficient it ſeemes to profeſſe diſlike of Poperie, though they bee vtterly ignorant in Rudiments of Orthodoxe Faith, &amp; grounds of pure worſhip of God.</p>

               <p>See if from the other Couſin, reſtrayning Grace wee may be able to diſcerne it.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17313:26"/>
               <p>Firſt, Reſtrayning Grace, if it bee onely reſtrayning, hath in it painefulneſſe; inward diſcontentment at the bridle, God puts into their mouthes. GODS Word <hi>is Bands; his Law</hi>

               <p>The heart truly ſanctified, is deſirous to be reſtrayned; yea, if it were poſſible, to haue inclinations to euill vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſhed. This they <hi>count their miſery,</hi> not that fleſh is bridled, but that it hath ſo much libertie<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.</note> 
                  <hi>to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of the minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Men reſtrayned only, not ſanctified, deſire to extend their libertie as farre as poſſibly may bee, with any colour or ſhew of lawfulneſſe, the thing once yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded lawfull, they ſeeme niceties not to be ſtood vpon, to enquire after expediencie, or with what limits and bounds they are lawfull in action. Thoſe Scriptures and Preachers pleaſe beſt, that ſeeme moſt to promiſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Libertie.</p>
               <p>A man truely ſanctified, chooſeth rather<note n="k" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſubſiſt within his bounds,</hi> then in any degree to exceede limits of lawfull Libertie: And is of his minde that ſaid, It is better to liue where nothing, then where all things are lawfull.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No ſmall difference ariſeth out of the Grounds of their abſtayning from euill, which in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, are feare or ſenſe of Gods wrath; of Magiſtrates Sword, Infamie and the like. Sometimes, ſome one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-luſt which they deſire to feed; are loth to croſſe, for whoſe ſake they curbe their other inordinate affections, that they breake not out into outrage, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the ancient Romans were reſtrayned from Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Iniuſtice, Couetouſneſſe, by that infinite Luſt they had after glory and large Dominions;<note place="margin">Aug. de Ciuit.

               <p>Fourthly, the reſtrayned, when meanes of reſtraint are once remoued, grow licentious, none more, as longing to quench their long thirſt after euill: when<note n="n" place="margin">

               </p>

                  <hi>to the righteous;</hi> he needs it not as a bridle by the terrours of it, though as a Directer by the Doctrine. Theſe are ſome helps to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne truth of ſanctification, from the counterfaits of it in Ciuilians, and men reſtrayned.</p>
               <p>There is annexed hereto a ſecond effect of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie and power thereof; their full aſſurance, their <hi>much full aſſurance:</hi> Whereof? of the diuine Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell taught them, by <hi>Paul</hi> and his Aſſociates. They make it of two ſorts, firſt, generall: ſecondly, particular, of whether the Text muſt be vnderſtood, is a queſtion. I thinke of both.</p>
               <p>Where the queſtion is, whether this vndoubtfull and full aſſurance of the Truth of the Goſpell be peculiar to Gods choſen: Thus I thinke wee may reſolue, by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the degrees of the minds aſſent in this kind, thus they are; the firſt is called commonly <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> more fitly <hi>coniecture:</hi> a lighter inclination and propenſion of the mind to the Goſpell, as poſſibly or probably true: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Opinion,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>herein the mind is ſtrongly ſwayed to thinke it true, but not without ſome feare of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Thirdly, the third they call <hi>Faith;</hi> a firme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtfull perſwaſion of the Truth of the Goſpell: which alſo hath its latitude: not only in the point of adherence,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17313:27"/> but in this of aſſent. Here we reade of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>little faith.</hi> Thus I thinke: Though the minds of Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and vnſanctified men, may be poſſeſſed with ſettled opinion of the Goſpels Truth, and ſo conuinced thereof that they are not able reaſonably to contradict it; yet that<note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>riches of aſſurance of the vnderſtanding to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the myſterie of Chriſt,</hi> is peculiar to Gods choſen. I may erre, but theſe reaſons ſway me: firſt, It is wrought by<note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>experience and ſenſe</hi> of the truth thereof. Secondly, imparted by <hi>the Spirit</hi> of God:<note n="r" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.6.</note> It is <hi>the Spirit which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that the Spirit is Truth.</hi> Thirdly, the fruit of it, me thinks, euidenceth it, to wit, <hi>firme adherence and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the goodneſſe</hi> apprehended in that Truth, ſuch as that no violence of perſecutions is able to remoue.</p>
               <p>As touching that other, which they call particular, it is ſo peculiar to Gods choſen, that no Reprobate partakes in it: to <hi>riches and much fulneſſe of aſſurance,</hi> few euen of Gods children aſcend.</p>
               <p>To further vs to that generall full aſſurance, theſe are helps affoorded to Gods children: firſt, the ſolid<note n="ſ" place="margin">

                  <hi>comfort and conſolation</hi> this <hi>Gospell affoords the conſcience,</hi> preſſed with ſenſe of Gods wrath due for ſinne. Secondly, that rauiſhing of the affections to loue of this Truth, ſo ſtrange and ſupernaturall, that whereas there is ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny antipathie in nature greater, then that betwixt<note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>mans heart</hi> in nature, and <hi>the Word of God;</hi> now a man is ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it, that the deareſt bloud is parted withall, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the leaſt jot of the Truth of the Goſpell. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that change ſo admirable it works in the whole man, from ſinne to righteouſneſſe. Theſe few Precepts of God, ſaith <hi>Lactantius,</hi>

                  </note> ſo change the whole man, and make him new, that you can hardly know him to be the ſame. A thing which Philoſophie hath much laboured in, but could neuer atchieue. The vtmoſt their morall wiſedome reacheth vnto, is this, it hides ſinnes rather then remoues
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17313:27"/> them; <hi>Sapientia eorum vt plurimùm efficiat, non exſcindit vitia ſed abſcondit.</hi> Theſe effects of the Word of God, are more auayleable to worke this fulneſſe of aſſurance, then any teſtimonie of the Church, howeuer magnified by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and to ſay truth, a great argument: but can an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimonie, being, firſt, variable: ſecondly, poſſibly erroneous, giue full ſatisfaction to the mind that doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth? <hi>Iudicent docti.</hi> And of theſe euidences of election thus farre, out of <hi>Pauls</hi> appeale to his hearers hearts, for record of this Truth, occurres nothing, that I dare do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally deliuer to the Church of God.</p>

               <p>Of his actions, yea geſtures indifferent, circumſtantial, incidental, we haue queſtions hotly diſputed. His geſture, eſpecially in the Sacrament, wee haue preſſed with might and mayne, and laid on vs by ſome, with as great neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as his moralities of Patience, Meekneſſe, Humilitie, Obedience. Me thinks then they ſhould be able to proue within compaſſe of thoſe things, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,<note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee gaue vs an example that wee ſhould follow his ſteps:</hi> to vrge any thing <hi>ſupra ſtatutum,</hi> as ſimply neceſſarie, is to vrge <hi>ſuperſtition:</hi> to yeeld to any thing <hi>ſupra ſtatutum,</hi> as ſimply neceſſarie, is to yeeld to <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi> Let them take heed that thus preſſe this geſture vpon our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as neceſſarie to be imitated, they incurre not crime of ſuperſtition, from which they would ſeeme to be moſt abhorrent.</p>
               <p>Are we bound to this geſture, ſo that to vſe any other, is ſinne? Yes, ſay they: then either becauſe it was amongſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17313:31"/> Chriſts morall acts, wherein he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded vs to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or elſe by vertue of that Mandate,<note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoc facite, Do this.</hi> A third member when they aſſigne me, I will take notice of. But neither was it amongſt his morall acts, wherein hee hath commanded vs to imitate; nor is it comprized within his Mandate, at the inſtitution. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May wee number it amongſt his morall acts? wee muſt then ſhew what Law of God, vertually at leaſt, compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth this Concluſion; Thou ſhalt ſit at the Sacrament. And againe, in religious moralities it is vnlawfull to doe <hi>aliud</hi> or <hi>aliter,</hi> other thing or otherwiſe: why then ſtand they? yea, why ſit they? why leane they not one in the boſome of another? or how dare they in the leaſt tittle ſwarue from their patterne?</p>
               <p>Comes it vnder the Mandate, <hi>Hoc facite?</hi> then is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Sacramentals of the Supper. For <hi>(hoc facite)</hi> comprizeth not Circumſtantials, but Sacramentals. Is it Sacramentall? where is the ſignification it hath of any act of God to vs, or of vs to God? Sacramentall actions all whether of the Miniſter, or Receiuer, haue their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall reſemblance and ſignification.</p>
               <p>Theſe eager ſpirits haue much haunted mee; the ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Argument they euer put forth to affright me withall, hath beene this, from the example of Chriſt. And though I neuer heard it vrged, but where the Anſwere hath made it totter; yet neuer could I ſway with any Miniſter, or other I haue dealt withall, as to make him forgoe his hold thereon: for in their Logicall Diſputes it is no abſurditie, to denie the Concluſion.</p>
               <p>I will truely acquaint you with the ſeuerall manners of vrging. The firſt paper is thus: That geſture that Chriſt and his Apoſtles vſed at the time of the inſtitution, is to be vſed of vs at the time of receiuing the Supper. But the geſture of ſitting is that geſture which Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles vſed at the time of the inſtitution: therefore muſt be vſed of vs.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:17313:31"/>
               <p>Formally enough. But when I wonder, will they proue their propoſition? that wee are bound to vſe the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, Veſtures, other circumſtances of firſt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And where appeares that Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſate, as we call ſitting?</p>
               <p>And why may I not thus reaſon? What Veſture Chriſt vſed at the firſt adminiſtration, is to bee vſed in ours. But a ſeameleſſe Coate was the Veſture which Chriſt vſed at the firſt adminiſtration. Therefore is to bee ſed of vs. I dare ſay the Argument proceedes as firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the habit, as for the ſite and poſition.</p>
               <p>The ſecond paper thus. To ſwerue from the imitable example of Chriſt, is a ſinne. Not to ſit in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, is to ſwerue from the imitable example of Chriſt, therefore not to ſit is a ſinne, <hi>&amp; per conſequens,</hi> to ſit a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty.</p>

               <p>To put end to this enquiry; Giue mee I pray, a true reaſon, why, his geſture in preaching, binds vs not to imitation, as well as his geſture in the Sacrament. My memory may faile me; but I know not, that it is euer recorded, Chriſt taught in any other ſite then ſitting.<note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>That he ſate downe</hi> and taught his Diſciples, I reade; that he ſtood, I reade not; a true difference betweene theſe in this point of neceſſary imitation, I would faine heare.</p>
               <p>The rite and outward forme of Baptiſme vſed by <hi>Iohn,</hi> whereto alſo our Sauiour ſubmitted himſelfe, was not ſprinkling, but<note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38.</note> 
                  <hi>going downe into the water;</hi> why are wee not ſtrictly bound to this imitable example of Chriſt and his Fore-runner? and yet muſt thinke our ſelues bound to his geſture in the Supper?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let this, though it may ſeeme a nicetie, bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of; that in this queſtion they change the very predicament where the inquiry lyeth. To ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and exactly, ſitting is not in the predicament of Action, but in that of ſite and poſition. And whereas in matter of imitation, the Actions of Chriſt fall onely into inquiry, they diuert the queſtion to his ſite and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>qua fide?</hi> And why ſhould wee not vrge the <hi>quando,</hi> and <hi>vbi,</hi> and <hi>habitus</hi> of Chriſts adminiſtration from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; aſwell as his geſture? Thus farre of that queſtion occaſionally; out of a deſire, if it bee poſſible, to giue ſatisfaction to the ſcrupulous, in as much as concernes the Argument from Chriſts example. This is the rule; The precept of imitating our bleſſed Sauiour, is limited to his actions, not extended to his geſtures; Among his actions, to thoſe that were morall, not to circumſtantiall, or incidentall.</p>
               <p>The laſt particular in the Text remaines, <hi>hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Word.</hi> Theſe wordes at firſt ſight I conceiued to expreſſe the ſpeciall matter wherein they imitated: And propounded the queſtion, how in receiuing the Word, they might be ſaid to imitate the Apoſtle and our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17313:32"/> conſidering, their imployment was rather in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the Word by preaching, then receiuing thereof by attending to others. And thus reſolued. There is a kind of oblique imitation of Chriſt and his Saints; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe when men apply the vertues exerciſed by Saints in their callings, to workes that concerne them in their place. As, Fortitude and Courage Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles manifeſted in preaching the Goſpell: This people in preaching vſed not their Fortitude; but in receiuing and maintayning the Goſpell expreſſed like Courage. The ſame Graces they are that all Saints exerciſe, yet as their callings are diſtinct, ſo are the imployments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they vſe them. The ſame Diligence, Fidelitie, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, all Gods people in their places and callings exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: though the acts wherein they are exerciſed, are as their callings, diſtinct. Suppoſe then thus, that in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Word, this people were Imitators of Chriſt and their Miniſters; becauſe what Courage, Conſtancie, Reſolution they ſhewed in preaching, theſe expreſſed in entertayning and maintayning the Goſpell. And this kind of imitation wee may vſe in the extraordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Saints. <hi>Abraham</hi> at Gods command <hi>is</hi>

That our dull hearts may the better be excited here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, reuiew the Arguments the Text affoords. Where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>greatneſſe of the</hi> miſerie from which we are freed, the <hi>wrath to come,</hi> the <hi>damnation of Hell,</hi> torments eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, endleſſe, and remedileſſe: the name of hell we iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tremble at; what thinke we, ſhould we doe, in the ſenſe of the torments? The Lord, the better to ſhew vs his rich Mercie in our deliuerance, is pleaſed ſometimes to caſt a flaſh of this fire into our conſcience, the Worme wee ſometimes feele gnawing and griping there; that little flea-biting, that ſhort payne, how intolerable is it! O thinke then, how rich the mercy of thy ſweet Sauiour was, in freeing thee from the extremitie and eternitie of that torment. Is one houres griping of this Worme ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable? what is a thouſand yeeres? what is eternitie? from this <hi>eternall wrath, Ieſus</hi> hath <hi>deliuered</hi> thee; and canſt thou not affoord him thankes for ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing?</p>
               <p>Let the next conſideration be of the perſons, <hi>Vs;</hi> this terme is doubly conſidered: Firſt, Abſolutely: Secondly,

Compare our ſelues with others. How many millions of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hath the Lord Chriſt ſuffered to periſh in the ſtate of nature? how many for birth, more noble; for policie, more wiſe; for riches, excelling more. In behauiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, perhaps more tolerable: yet vs, the <hi>least of all Saints, the chiefe of all ſinners</hi> hath the Lord deliuered: mooues not this to thankfulneſſe? See then the meanes of thy deliuerance: himſelfe was <hi>made a curſe</hi> for vs, ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the wrath of God, to the paynes of Hell, all this to worke our deliuerance: me thinks wee ſhould now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ſay to our ſoules as DAVID,<note n="h" place="margin">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Miniſterie, are to be encouraged; that no feare, or other by-reſpect, make vs ſuppreſſe any part of Gods Truth, <hi>expedient</hi> for the people to know. Reaſons are many: Firſt, it is that, that procures vs authoritie in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the people. I know not how, things timorouſly deliuered, though neuer ſo truely, lacke their life in the Hearers hearts, whiles they beginne to thinke, our ſelues ſuſpect the Truth, of what we deliuer.

               <p>Secondly, The people hence learne, as not to forget their Miniſters in Prayer to GOD for this grace to bee doubled vpon them; ſo to bleſſe God that ſtirres vp the Spirits of their Paſtors, to deale thus freely in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.

               <p>Why they doe not in the euent; ordinarily meane; ſometimes it is true, we bewray humane frailtie, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſo it is, that as corruption in men vnregenerate, the more it is oppoſed, the more it ſtormes, and growes outragious; ſo Grace, the more it is oppoſed, the more inflamed like new<note n="f" place="margin">

In the words are two things. Firſt, <hi>Pauls</hi> ſincere behauiour in his Miniſterie. Secondly, his reaſons and motiues thereto. <hi>He ſought not to pleaſe men, but God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The point is this, <hi>A Miniſter may not bee a man-pleaſer;</hi> more then that <hi>man-pleaſing cannot ſtand with ſinceritie:</hi> ſome thus explaine; hee may not pleaſe men againſt God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when men cannot bee pleaſed, but with GODS diſpleaſure: the rule is good to walke by; but this further conceiue it, as meant not ſimply <hi>de euentu,</hi> but <hi>de conatu:</hi> hee is not preſently inſincere. In whom it ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals, that men perhaps of corrupt mindes, finde pleaſing, and contentment: Euen to the Hypocrites of Sion, <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiels</hi> Miniſtry was for a while, <hi>as</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Muſicke:</hi> and our Sauiour his doctrine is admired by the people, they that ment to apprehend him, giue him this teſtimonie;<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.46.</note> 
                  <hi>Neuer man ſpake, as this man ſpeakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But vnderſtand it, <hi>de conatu:</hi> when a man bends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to this as his maine end, to pleaſe men, and yeeld them contentment: This is it that cannot ſtand with a Miniſters ſinceritie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by men, vnderſtand carnall men, as they are ſuch; they that deſire to pleaſe carnalitie, muſt alter the nature of that doctrine wherewith God hath inſtructed them; <hi>it is enmitie to the fleſh;</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>the fleſh to it.</hi> Our doctrine <hi>is ſalt;</hi> wholeſome and tending to preſerue from putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but not without much tartneſſe and byting.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:17313:64"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Vnderſtand it chiefly of our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not of our ciuil conuerſation in things indifferent. <hi>Pauls</hi> practice was, in vſe of libertie to pleaſe all men in all indifferent things: wee may not thinke that in doctrine and morall practice, hee tempered his behauiour ſo as to pleaſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, with theſe limits; how farre a Miniſter ſhould bee from this humour of man-pleaſing, theſe reaſons prooue.</p>

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>If I pleaſe men, I am not the Servant of Chriſt,</hi> that is, if I bend and apply my ſelfe to fit the people with doctrines pleaſing to the humours of carnall men; or made mans fauour the vtmoſt of mine intention, I were not the ſeruant of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in falſe prophets this noted as a propertie and blemiſh, <hi>to ſeeke out Placentia</hi> for the people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it croſſes the maine end of preaching, to bring men to Repentance. Hereby the<note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13.22</note> 
                  <hi>hands of the wicked are ſtrengthned, not to returne from their euill way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it be to vs, in place of Miniſters, a warning to flye this fault: then which, I know not any more pernicious in a Miniſter: Three wayes it is incurred;</p>
               <p>Firſt, in matter of Doctrine: when it is ſuch as is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the erroneous opinions and corrupt affections of men. As falſe apoſtles in Galatia, loth to offend Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by reiecting Chriſt; as loth to diſpleaſe Chriſtians Iudaizing: or too much to abaſe the pride of nature; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to pleaſe carnally, thus moderated the matter; CHRIST muſt bee the principall and originall; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and Nature ſecond Cauſes to perfect Iuſtification. Right as Papiſts now, to aſcribe all to Nature, were too groſſe Pelagianiſme; to take from men all libertie in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, too diſtaſtefull to pride of nature; let grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue the principalitie; nature, a power, vpon excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to worke with the Spirit of God; thus they ſhall pleaſe all parts. Amongſt our ſelues, how many are in this kind guiltie? to legitimate Adultery, Drunkenneſſe, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from religious exerciſes on the Sabbath, were too
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17313:65"/> open Libertiniſme; but wanton words, ſitting by the Cup in good fellowſhip on the Lords Day, ſuch as theſe muſt be permitted: wherefore? I maruell: except to pleaſe carnally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In manner of preaching and deliuery: The falſe apoſtles in Corinth, perceiuing how the naked ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching grew irkeſome to nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eares of Grecians; bent their ſtudies, almoſt who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to words, and in preaching grew emulous of Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Oratours, vnder pretence perhaps, to make the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine more plauſible; in truth to humour the people, and to winne to themſelues the vaine prayſe of Eloquence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A man may teach truth, naked truth nakedly, and yet be guiltie of this crime of man-pleaſing; as when his ayme is this, to giue contentment to the people, and to winne himſelfe applauſe from the Hearers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſith this is a fault in a Miniſter, ſee, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, ſee the great errour of many; that, in opinion of their greater diſcretion then GOD hath granted to their Teachers, are become Preſcribers vnto their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. And though, I dare ſay, they haue ſcarce learn'd the Art of good hearing: yet thinke themſelues able men to giue Precepts and Rules of Preaching. One is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many; A Miniſter muſt ſo carry himſelfe in his Doſtrine, that hee may by no meanes offend his people: For if they loue vs not, wee ſhall neuer doe them good by Preaching. A kinde of popular pleaſing carriage they would haue in a Miniſter; ſuch belike, as that the moſt carnall, and prophane amongſt his Hearers may not be offended.</p>
               <p>Which if they vnderſtand of iuſt offences, they haue vs eaſily according. But doe you not remember what our Sauiour anſweres, when his Diſciples bring tydings that Phariſes were offended?<note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>If they will be offended, let them be offended:</hi> It is truth and neceſſary truth I haue taught; let them bewray their blindneſſe, Chriſt repents not his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17313:65"/> Preaching. And when <hi>Ieremie</hi> complained of that iſſue of his Preaching, <hi>euery man curſed him;</hi> what ſaith the anſwere of God vnto him? if he will be <hi>a Prophet after Gods heart,</hi>

                  <hi>he muſt ſtill take away the precious from the vile;</hi> yea ſee, how ſtiffe he requires him to be in that caſe: <hi>Let them turne to thee, turne not thou to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle tels vs of a dangerous diſeaſe in the eares of men: It is the<note n="q" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>itching of the eare:</hi> it hath this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; it cannot endure wholeſome Doctrine, but vaine, triuiall, fabulous things it delights to be tickled withall. God forbid, any faithfull Paſtor ſhould tickle it. Salt is better for it, then Oyle: though it bee more byting, it is much more ſoueraigne.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Haue wee not ſeene the power of the Word, ſo farre changing the temper of the heart, that it hath made of enemies friends? how many have come to heare, as the Phariſes our Sauiour, to intangle him in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who yet haue <hi>gone away relenting,</hi> and whoſe ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more hopeleſſe then that of <hi>ſcoffers.</hi> Yet haue we ſeene them ſodainly brought<note n="r" place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, Heare what Gods Spirit, vpon like occaſion, anſweres to his Seruant <hi>Iohn.</hi> It ſeemes hee was troubled with ſome ſuch doubt; little hope there appeared of good to come by publiſhing the Booke; yet is his charge:<note n="ſ" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, by this, you heare to be a fault in the Miniſter, you of the people may take notice of like faults in your ſelues, ſome few palpable in this kind amongſt the people ſhall be noted. Two ſorts of men we find faultie in this kind: the firſt are, in truth, ſtarke Atheiſts, vngodly men, their diſpoſition ſuch, as the Poets fable of their <hi>Proteus,</hi>

Amongſt Saints, they can Saint it; and amongſt Deuils, play the Deuils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Come they amongſt men religious, their ſpeech, geſtures, all things ſhall pretend Religion: Are they ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with profane perſons? to them alſo they ſuite their manners. And it is a world to ſee how they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in this man-pleaſing carriage, and thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues greateſt Politicians, the onely wiſe amongſt men: what thinke wee, are theſe but ſtarke Atheiſts, without God in this world?<note n="t" place="margin">

               <p>A ſecond ſort are our peaceable, ciuill, honeſt men, as they would be termed; whoſe chiefe ſtudie is to haue the good will, and good word of all men, their glorie in contentions euen for Gods cauſe ſo to carry themſelues, that they diſpleaſe neither ſide.

               <p>The next thing here deſeruing our notice, is the Anti-theſis betwixt the two, <hi>God and man; pleaſing men, and pleaſing God,</hi> as if he thought them to be incompatible; and were of opinion, that <hi>a man deſiring to pleaſe men, could not pleaſe God:</hi> and certainly it is a truth, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as afore.

               <p>That this ſeeme no paradoxe, conſider the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie betwixt corrupted nature, and Gods pure Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie; light and darkneſſe, good and euill: or, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that haue greater repugnancie, are not more contrariant, then Gods nature and carnall man: ſee, if you will, the things proceeding from God to man, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſtamp of his puritie; and iudge, whether there be not natural enmitie in mans nature againſt them.

               <p>Secondly, ſee we, how fooliſhly men pleaſe themſelues in this, that they ſo demeane themſelues, as to pleaſe all, euen carnall men. A great thing to thanke God on, <hi>q.d.</hi> they thanke God for this, that they diſpleaſe God, and lacke their euidence of his fauour. In ſuch mens pleaſing carriage one of there two, I dare ſay, is incurred. Firſt, either running with them to the ſame exceſſe of ryot,<note n="c" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4.</note>

               <p>Laſtly, ceaſe hence to wonder at that cauſeleſſe wrath riſing in carnall men againſt Gods children: the reaſon is euident, when <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> asketh of <hi>Achab,</hi> whether there were no other Prophet by whom to enquire of the mouth of the Lord? Yes, ſaith <hi>Achab,</hi> one there is, MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAIAH <hi>by name,</hi> and wee may by him inquire of the Lord, hee is likely to giue vs as good reſolution as any of the reſt, <hi>but</hi>

                  <hi>I hate him:</hi> why? <hi>hee prophecieth not good to mee, but euill:</hi> hee dealt as a Miniſter deſiring to pleaſe God. What wonder, if to <hi>Achab</hi> a carnall man, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie and perſon was ſo hatefull?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not as pleaſing men, but God.</hi> So then, the <hi>mayne ayme of a Miniſter, of euery Chriſtian ſhould be this;</hi> ſo <hi>to walke that he may pleaſe God, and be approued of him.</hi> See 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p>His reaſon (me thinks) is binding, <hi>we muſt all appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudgement ſeate of Chriſt:</hi> a motiue, that ſhould preuayle euen with vileſt men: pleaſe that Iudge, at whoſe barre thou muſt one day ſtand, to be quit or condemned, according as thy perſon and actions ſhall pleaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him: we pitie the folly, and madneſſe of that male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, that ſtanding at the mercy of the Iudge for life or death, according as his after-carriage ſhall pleaſe or
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17313:67"/> diſpleaſe him, will rather exaſperate him, then ſeeke by all pleaſing meanes to make him fauourable; ſuch is our caſe; we all are culpable before God, and lyable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, at his mercy wee ſtand to be either ſaued or damned: his deſire is but this, that for the remaynder of our life, wee ſo demeane our ſelues in holineſſe and feare, that wee may pleaſe him; whom ſhould not this reaſon perſwade? Let vs all labour ſo to ſerue him, that we may be pleaſing and acceptable before him in Chriſt. Things requiſite hereto, ſome concerne the ſtate of our perſons, ſome the matter of our actions, ſome the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: two things there are that make our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and actions diſpleaſing vnto God: Firſt, faithleſneſſe: Secondly, fleſhlineſſe. Of HENOCH <hi>there was report before his tranſlation, that he pleaſed God;</hi> by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it followes in <hi>Pauls</hi> diuinitie, that therefore HE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOCH<note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>had faith</hi> in Chriſt, inaſmuch as <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> The reaſon is plaine, becauſe all the faithleſſe mans actions, whiles hee is ſuch, are cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable according to termes of the Law, wherein the leaſt blemiſh or imperfection adiudgeth the performer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: here is the priuilege of the Beleeuer, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience done in weakneſſe, ſo be it in ſinceritie, is ſure to find acceptance with God, for Chriſt his ſake, to whom Faith knits vs, and whoſe perfections it giues vs intereſt vnto.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing, in the perſon, making actions vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, <hi>is fleſhlineſſe: They that are in</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8.</note> 
                  <hi>the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God,</hi> all things ſauouring fleſh, are ſtinking in the noſtrils of God, euen our beſt actions that haue relliſh thereof: this the reaſon, why thoſe vertuous actions of Heathens, were in them ſo abominable, becauſe their perſons were faithleſſe, and fleſhly; God approues his owne works in vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the matter of our actions, they muſt be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:17313:68"/> ſuch as haue warrant from the Word of God; <hi>prooue what is acceptable vnto God, and</hi>

                  <hi>what the good and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will of God is.</hi> Whatſoeuer is contrariant to his will, that is groſly a ſinne; whatſoeuer is added to his will, or but beſides it, that alſo abominable.</p>
               <p>In manner of our ſeruice that it may be acceptable, two things are requiſite.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it bee tendred to our <hi>God</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">

                  <hi>in reuerence and feare.</hi> Let euery act of ſeruice done vnto, carry a relliſh of awe and dread of that endleſſe Maieſtie. Thinke when thou commeſt to heare, how great a God that is, in whoſe preſence thou ſtandeſt; whoſe Word thou heareſt; a God that is in his wrath a conſuming fire, and learne, as <hi>Iſay,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In ſinceritie and ſingleneſſe of heart, as vnto the Lord, that pondreth the hearts: which is with God a thing ſo much ſet by, that hee eſteemes it as perfection.</p>
               <p>And of <hi>Pauls</hi> behauiour thus farre, his motiues follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Meditation of the great fauour God had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed him, <hi>in truſting him with the Goſpell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſideration of Gods Omni-ſcience, and power to <hi>diſcerne hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt, conſiderable are</p>
               <p>Firſt, The effect that meditation had in the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The fauour it ſelfe. It made him carefull to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So workes the meditation of Gods fauours in a gracious diſpoſition, ſo ought it to doe in all men,</hi> that <hi>they become carefull to pleaſe God.</hi> Compare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8, 11. <hi>Iohn</hi> 24.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47.</p>
               <p>More ſpecially thus conceiue; the <hi>ſpecialtie of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in truſting</hi> him with his greateſt treaſure, was it that chiefly preuayled.</p>

                  <hi>The preferment God giues any of vs in his fauour, ought ſpecially to perſwade obedience and care to pleaſe God.</hi> He had dealt with <hi>Iſrael</hi>

                  <hi>Fathers, in making this Couenant with vs;</hi> ſo much more ſhould we thinke our ſelues obliged to obedience. See alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>The more odious is the turning of Gods grace into wantonneſſe, the abuſe of his patience to ſecuritie, his mercie to preſumption; his loue to licentiouſneſſe; yea, the fauour of fauours, Chriſts death is made occaſion of the vileſt abominations. So did not <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> they haue leaſt ſhare in Gods fauours, that thus abuſe them to licentiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Our dutie it ſhall bee, for our better excitement to cheerefulneſſe in Gods Seruice, to take notice of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialtie of his fauour and louing kindneſſe towards vs. There is not, nor can be to Gods Children a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation to faithfulneſſe in his Seruice: nor is any thing in experience a greater clogge to our hearts in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then that vnwiſe and enuious caſting our eyes on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers preferments in Gods mercy, with neglect of our owne, while euery man thinkes God hath done more for others, then for him, It is good in this caſe to looke downewards; and ſee how many are behinde vs in the fauours of God. And here haue we a large field of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to walke in, there ſcarce being any but may ſay, in <hi>ſome thing</hi> or other <hi>God hath giuen him preeminence</hi> aboue many others. Compare thy ſelfe as a man with other creatures: as a Chriſtian with other men; as a ſincere Chriſtian with Hypocrites: as ſuch a Chriſtian, ſuppoſe a Magiſtrate or Miniſter, with other Chriſtians. It was in Gods power to haue made thee a beaſt, hee hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thee ſo farre, as to make thee a man, to ſtampe thee with his owne Image; hee might haue left thee as thouſand others without God, without Chriſt, without hope in this World: he hath made thee a member of his Church: perhaps a liuely member of his Sonnes Bodie,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17313:69"/> quickened with his Spirit; a fauour denyed to many in the Church. Perhaps a Miniſter, his inſtrument and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker to the ſauing of his people. Thus if wee could carefully obſerue the ſpecialtie wee haue in Gods fauour, how ſhould our hearts be enlarged to thankefulneſſe and fidelitie in his Seruice?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let vs on this occaſion enquire, how the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gods fauours workes on vs. And ſo much the rather: Becauſe</p>
               <p>Firſt, Herein depends no ſmall difference twixt Gods Childe, and an Hypocrite; and</p>
               <p>Secondly, the motiues to obedience are the things that ſpecially forme, and determine our obedience to accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or otherwiſe. The workes of obedience in any calling, may bee performed by an Hypocrite. From the workes therefore no man can firmely conclude the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his heart; from the motiues hee may; and from none other more firmely, then this; that the experience and meditation of Gods loue excites vs. Thou mayſt name the Hypocrite, whoſe workes, for their out-ſide, haue beene as glorious, as thoſe of Gods Saints; An Hypocrite, that from this ground hath done a good dutie, thou ſhalt not find amongſt the tenne thouſands of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Iehu,</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 10.16, 30, 31.</note> he did what God <hi>commanded in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying</hi> BAAL <hi>his Priests,</hi> ACHABS <hi>poſteritie;</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues were, partly <hi>vaine-glory;</hi> partly, deſire to <hi>ſettle</hi> the Kingdome vpon his <hi>owne Poſteritie.</hi> Wherefore, though hee had ſeene Gods hand on <hi>Ieroboam</hi> for his Idolatry, yet vpon the ſame politike ground, hee continues the ſinne. The fauour it ſelfe followeth: <hi>Hee was approoued of God,</hi> ſo farre as to be <hi>entruſted</hi> with the Goſpell, obſerue it as a <hi>compendium of the honour and office of a Miniſter; God truſts him with the Goſpell,</hi> the greateſt treaſure of the Church.

               <p>The parts of this truſt are, Firſt, ſafe cuſtodie, care to preſerue it from adulterating by Heretikes, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, faithfull diſpenſation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.3. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>It is a prettie inference <hi>Sasbout</hi> hath hence, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that <hi>ſerua depoſitum</hi> enioyned to <hi>Timothie,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Diſcimus ex hoc loco, &amp;c.</hi> wee learne from this place, that in <hi>Pauls</hi> time the myſteries of Religion were not depoſed with the <hi>vulgus,</hi> but with the Biſhops of the Church, <hi>plebi id tantum ſciendum eſt, quod ad mores forman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, &amp; ad vitam pertinet:</hi> yet the Apoſtle <hi>Iudes</hi> charge to the whole Church, is, <hi>to</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But I anſwere: In reſpect of <hi>publike diſpenſation,</hi> and ſpecially of care to keepe it pure from deprauation, it is Miniſters priuilege to be entruſted with the Goſpell, in reſpect of <hi>knowing, beleeuing, maintayning,</hi> euen with dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt bloud: It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to all, and euery of the Church of God: the diſpenſation is ours, that is our honour, the beliefe and defence of the Goſpell belongs to all, euen the meaneſt amongſt the <hi>vulgus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, thus better may Miniſters vſe the meditation, as a helpe to digeſt the indignities they ſuffer from carnall men, and that baſe eſteeme their perſons and calling are ſubiect vnto.

               <p>As many of vs as call vpon the Name of the LORD, and deſire to depart from this iniquitie of hypocriſie, this let vs meditate; To <hi>the eyes</hi> of that God <hi>with whom wee haue to deale, all things are naked, and vncouered,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Truth is, ſuch muſt expect the moſt exquiſite of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations, moſt ſubtilly contriued, with greateſt violence vrged, inaſmuch as hee knowes; Firſt, it is not his ordinarie skill that preuayles againſt them. Secondly, by their falls expects a double aduantage.</p>
               <p>Firſt, their falls he thinks likely the feares of others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours in grace; and hopes, the great Champions once ouercome, the petty Souldiers will dread the encounter; as<note n="p" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.51</note> 
                  <hi>Philiſtims fled</hi> when their <hi>Gyant</hi> was ouerthrowne.

                  <hi>perfects his power in weakneſſe;</hi> enabling a weake Nouice to endure that brunt of temptation, that ſtronger men haue beene borne downe withall.</p>
               <p>A ſecond aduantage hee aymes at in their temptation and ouerthrow, thus conceiue: Eminent examples hee knowes are preualent whether in good or euill. No pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent hath proued more pernicious in euill, then that of the moſt eminent in the grace of God: ſeldome fall ſuch alone; but their falls are like the falls of mightie Cedars, bearing down before them a multitude of weaker plants.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Security, when men conceited of their ſtrength, grow careleſſe of the danger they are in, crying peace to themſelues: theſe forſooth are at defiance with Satan, and dare almoſt dare him to doe his worſt. Oh conſider,

                  <hi>to draw our hearts from God, and to entice to diſobedience.</hi> The parts of temptation are three; Firſt, <hi>Suggeſtion: the caſting of euill thoughts into the minde;</hi> as into<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.2.</note> IVDAS <hi>his heart,</hi> the Deuill threw that thought, <hi>to betray his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> Secondly, <hi>perſwaſion;</hi> the preſſing of the ſuggeſtion with ſome reaſons that may perſwade the minde to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, incline the will to conſent to that euill as good. The ſuggeſtion is after a ſort the concluſion; the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the argument to enforce it. <hi>Example:</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Eate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit;</hi> is the ſuggeſtion to <hi>Eue;</hi> Ye <hi>ſhall bee as gods,</hi> the perſwaſion.<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <hi>Caſt thy ſelfe downe headlong;</hi> the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. The <hi>Angels haue charge to keepe thee,</hi> the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>And it is vrged, firſt, ſometimes by way of inticement; as when by promiſe of ſome good that giuing way to the ſuggeſtion drawes with it, we are allured rather then terrified: as the euill ſpirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, vndertakes <hi>to</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.21</note> 
                  <hi>entice him,</hi> by promiſing proſperous Voyage to Ramoth Gilead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes in way of terrour; as when by expounding ſome fearefull euill, he labours to draw from vs conſent to his ſuggeſtions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The laſt part of Satanicall temptation, is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation.</hi> The inſtant and importunate vrging of the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; giuing no reſt till he hath procured conſent, if it be poſſible. <hi>Satan</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 21.1.</note> 
                  <hi>prouoked</hi> DAVID <hi>to number the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> It ſeemes hee was not ſatisfied with once ſuggeſting or perſwading that thought of Pride, but with inſtance againe and againe renewed, preſſed onwards to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>The kinds follow: they are diuerſly diſtinguiſhed; firſt, <hi>ex modo.</hi> Firſt, Some are immediate, wherein Satan vſeth no inſtrument in tempting; as in that of our Sauiour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Some mediate, wherein men or women are vſed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17313:113"/> as his inſtruments; ſo tempted he <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Eue; Ahab</hi> by falſe prophets. Thirdly, Some mixt; as wherein perhaps the ſuggeſtion is from Satan immediately; the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or inſtigation by his inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Ex euentu;</hi> by their iſſue; ſome are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſome ineffectuall temptations; <hi>Effectuall,</hi> wherein he preuayles, more or leſſe. <hi>Ineffectuall,</hi> wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles not: as in our Sauiour,<note n="n" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Reaſons of tempting in reſpect of Satan.</p>
               <p>Firſt, His enuie at mans poſſible felicitie: through en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of the Deuill came ſinne into the World.<note place="margin">Bern. de aduentu Serm. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> It is <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> opinon, that man was created to ſupply the defect of Angels in Heauen, and to repayre that breach that their fall had made in the heauenly Ieruſalem. Satan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying vs that happineſſe, labours by temptation to draw vs from it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The blinde malice and ſpight wherein hee is carryed againſt God and his Chriſt. The ſenſe of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which hee indures, makes him oppoſe, as much as may be, whatſoeuer is glorious to God; as is the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſaluation of his Children.</p>
               <p>Reaſons of GODS permiſſion if any aske; though it ſhould ſuffice vs to know, the Lord keepes the hooke in his noſtrils, and wils nothing of his Children but what he ouer-rules to their good: yet probably theſe may bee alledged: Firſt,<note n="o" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note> 
                  <hi>To humble</hi> his Children, and <hi>preuent Pride</hi> and ſecuritie. Secondly, That Chriſt not only in perſon, but in his members may conquer Satan. Thirdly, That the equitie of giuing<note n="p" place="margin">

In which opinion, beſide more obſcure and Philoſophicall explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what great oddes can bee diſcerned from that wee teach? Euen we confeſſe there may be true Faith, where Charitie is not, true in it kind; aſſenting firmely to the whole truth of God, which ſome call Catholike, ſome Hiſtoricall Faith. But that there ſhould bee iuſtifying Faith, and ſuch as giues vs intereſt to Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and eternall life, without Charitie; wee hold a dreame phantaſticall, hauing no footing in the Word of God.</p>

               <p>Sure, if it bee true, that our people generally vaunt of themſelues, neuer were times fuller of faith, then theſe laſt dayes, of which Chriſt propheſied a ſcarcetie, and as I may ſay, a famine of faith: There is no man ſo prophane, ſo ignorant, ſo rancorouſly malicious againſt GODS Children, but profeſſeth faith as firme as <hi>Abrahams;</hi> as effectuall almoſt, as that of Martyrs: Bring wee it to this Touch-ſtone:</p>

               <p>The LORD ſeemes notwithout cauſe to preſcribe vs this order of louing; perhaps to worke in vs a holy kinde of emulation, and ſtriuing to excell in gracious gifts and practices. Certainly, there is eaſily obſerued in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, a deſire, perhaps from Gods owne inſpirement, to be deare and entyre to the Saints of God; and a kind of ambition, to be of more then ordinary eſteeme amongſt Gods Children.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Faith, the more implicite, the more defectiue: the more explicite, the more perfect.

               <p>Firſt, Suppoſe Chriſt a meere Creature, how canſt thou
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17313:127"/> be aſſured his obedience or paſſion was ſatisfactory for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thee? by right of Creation, God hath abſolute power ouer his creature, to inioyn it any thing to be done or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; the creatures, becauſe creatures, ſtand bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.

               <p>As Creatour and Gouernour of the world, they knew him: as Redeemer, in Chriſt, they knew him not.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome imperfect and ineffectuall notices they had of the Godhead, ſuch as depriued of excuſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge effectuall and powerfull to reforme, they had not. And hereof would the Apoſtle be chiefly vnderſtood.</p>

               <p>The generall rule of direction, is this: <hi>There muſt be equalitie betwixt the thing, and the price;</hi> ſo that, what oddes ſoeuer there is in the exceſſe or defect, betwixt the price and the value, that is all to be imputed to iniuſtice.</p>
               <p>All the queſtion is, how this equalitie muſt be iudged. The generall obſeruation is; that the value of things, paſſing in exchange, cannot ordinarily be found out, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by probabilities: Nor punctually deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but by common eſtimation. Howbeit generall directions are on this manner.</p>
               <p>The value or worth of things is of two ſorts. Firſt, naturall: Secondly, vſuall: thus for better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The value or worth of things is attended, either according to excellency giuen them in Creation; or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fitneſſe, and auayle for vſe. In matter of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17313:146"/> contract, we reſpect not the value Naturall; but eſteeme the worth by conueniency for vſe. In Nature, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is one Sparrow, or Gnat, the meaneſt liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then Pearles or Diamonds: Life and Senſe are things of more excellencie, then any other qualities in liueleſſe creatures; yet according to vſe, of more worth is bread then thouſands of theſe <hi>animalcula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The value in reſpect of vſe, is thus eſteemed. Firſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vertuouſneſſe of the thing, and the reall properties it hath to be auayleable and of force for vſe. So a cloth ſubſtantiall and skilfully wrought, is of more worth, then that which is ſleighted. A beaſt ſtrong and nimble for labour, better then a weake or dull Aſſe: their reall properties make them more fit for vſe, and ſo of more value.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is attended according to ſcarcetie and rareneſſe of commodities. Times of ſcarcetie, make times of dearth. In Samaria, during the ſiege, <hi>an</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, according to the minde of the Seller or Buyer, and that contentment or pleaſance he conceiues in the thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to theſe may be added, common eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; according whereto the price of moſt things is vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudged of.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, there be that annexe conſideration of Places and Countries; which affoords no ſmall varietie of price and worth, in things thus exchanged. To theſe all or ſome, Iuſtice commutatiue requires the price to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned; ſo that if the Seller exact a price notably exceeding the worth of the thing; or the Buyer giue a price <hi>ſcienter,</hi> farre inferiour to the due value, both are ſaid in this kind to ouer-reach.

               <p>Againſt it offend ſundrie ſorts of men, hauing framed to themſelues other rules, the very ruines of Iuſtice in this kind. Amongſt many this goes currant: Things, they ſay, are worth as they may haue for them. A rule too too fallacious and deceitfull. And many times the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is, to get ſome Partner in the fraud, to bid largely, and then, equiuocally they can ſweare, to deceiue the ſimple: <hi>Thus much they were offered.</hi> Chriſtianitie hath no ſuch rules to walke by; except they bee cautelouſly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. What if ſome ſimpler man, not knowing the worth of the thing, or forced by neceſsitie, hath ouer-bid the value? that is no rule to guide thy conſcience; the rule of worth, is the fitneſſe of the commoditie for vſe, or generally common eſtimation, or thoſe other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of times and places.</p>

The diſcreet price, is thus expreſſed: ſo it is not deare; it is a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable price betwixt man and man.

               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:17313:148"/>
               <p>There is another price, which they call <hi>pretium aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatum</hi> or <hi>multiplicatum;</hi> ſo called, becauſe in reſpect of forbearance, it is augmented aboue the worth of the thing in extremitie. Whether is this kind of ſelling for day, a breach of Iuſtice? The generall anſwere is, that it is an apparant violation of Iuſtice commutatiue, becauſe equalitie is not kept betwixt the thing and the price. Howbeit, there are of opinion, reſpect may bee had to mens poſsible or probable damage: and looke what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in probabilitie the Seller may ſuſtayne by ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, for it, the Seller may prouide in <hi>euentum;</hi> by adding to the price aboue the worth. But if gayne be that is aymed at therein, the contract cannot be excuſed of Iniuſtice, being meerely vſurious. And of the firſt ſinne againſt Iuſtice, by ouer-reaching, thus farre.</p>
               <p>The helper forward of it, is Fraud; whereof, ſee <hi>Annot. ad Rom.</hi> 1.29. To ſet downe the ſeuerall ſorts of deceit vſed in matters of contract, were infinite, and in truth impoſsible; ſo wittie is the world growne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their Brother, their owne Fathers, as wee ſay in the Prouerbe, in the iſſue, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>their owne ſoules;</hi> out of which ill manners of men, haue growne many good Lawes for Weights and Meaſures, &amp;c. yet neuer was there Law of man ſo cautelous and prouident, as to preuent all particulars; the ſubtle wit of men whetted from Hell, is ſo nimble to deuiſe euaſions, that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe their Trades are called Crafts, Myſteries; as is ſaid of Antichriſtianiſme, <hi>Myſteries of iniquitie:</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are numberleſſe.

               <p>I obſerue it the rather, becauſe our people haue in this caſe framed to themſelues Diſtinctions; ſuch as Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their policie taught their children: they muſt lye, and not lye, with a diſtinction: lye to their enemies; tell truth to their friends. Not vnlike are thoſe amongſt our people; ſomething ſhamefull it is thought to deceiue a friend; but for a Stranger, the excuſe is currant, He was a Stranger to me; no reaſon of reſpect betwixt vs. A ſimple man that puts confidence in them, they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſcrupulous to deceiue; but if he be one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

Children, ſaith <hi>Xenophon,</hi> forgat their diſtinction, and made bold ſometimes to lie to their beſt friends. So they that thus diſtinctly begin to practiſe iniuſtice, at length grow to promiſcuous iniquity; ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring neither friend, nor brother, no nor their owne father, to aduantage their commoditie. Should not the Lord be auenged of ſuch a people? Yes.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The Load-ſtone of this loue, is their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Modus</hi> is, Brotherly; that is, firſt, It is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> naturall and kindly, flowing from inward propenſion and ſelfe-inclination; needs no outward allurements or
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17313:154"/> prouocations to procure it: The very name of a Brother is potent enough to draw affections. Secondly, Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whether poore or rich, &amp;c. except where naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are quite extinct, the bowels yearne after bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Thirdly, Intire and feruent; nothing breakes the bond of brotherly loue. Proportionally thinke of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian amitie, in men partakers of the Spirit of adoption.</p>
               <p>The euidences and fruits of it are, firſt, tendereſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and fellow-feeling of miſeries; ſecondly, ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their diſtreſſes, and chearefull<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>diſtributing</hi> to their neceſſities; thirdly, ſociall conuerſing together for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall comfort and edification. So was the cuſtome of ancient Saints; and thoſe were the times when Grace thriued in Gods children. Now, I know not how, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren haue almoſt forgotten that they are Brethren; and euery man ſtands aloofe, when neceſſitie requires their ſuccour. My brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be. We are all <hi>children of one Father,</hi> partaking <hi>the ſame Spirit of adoption,</hi> haue <hi>one hope of the ſame heauenly inheritance;</hi> and that ſhared for the meaſures of it, <hi>according</hi>

               <p>The nature of the dutie is thus; the exhortation to it, we ſee carried Rhetorically; the Apoſtle, Orator-like, inſinuating himſelfe, and entering their boſomes, as it were, <hi>in tranſcurſu.</hi> With like <hi>artificium</hi> wee ſee him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt<note n="i" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1.</note> 
                  <hi>wreſting</hi> from <hi>Corinthians</hi> their contribution; when Rhetorically he ſeemes to paſſe by that which his deſire is to preſſe with greateſt inſtance. And how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſiue with<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <hi>Agrippa,</hi> was that acknowledgement of his preſent faith?</p>
               <p>Truth is, the good opinion of him that perſwades, is more then many Arguments, alluring and perſwaſiue with euery ingenuous diſpoſition. Withall, wee muſt heed the differences betwixt flatterie, and this holy Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique. Firſt, Flatterie aſcribes good things where they
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:17313:154"/> are not. This pious Rhetorique will ſee ground for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Secondly, the flatterers aime in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is his owne commoditie. Theſe heauenly Orators therefore inſinuate, that they may lead on the people to conſtancie in good duties.</p>
               <p>Like prudence is requiſite in vs, to prouoke to holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: take notice of, and commend the good that is in any; thou knoweſt not what heartening prudent commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may be vnto him. The Lord himſelfe lets paſſe no good thing in any, though clouded with infirmities, without laudatorie notice of it. See <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The harſhneſſe of many in their cenſures, readier to vilifie the beſt things, then to couer their imperfections; how many hath it kept from entertaining holy courſes! If any be for the preſent alien, though not without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hope of reclaiming, he is ſtraightwaies cenſured, as another <hi>Elymas,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>enemie to all goodneſſe, and child of the Deuill.</hi> Yea, where Charitie cannot but diſcerne Seeds and beginnings of Grace, except they haue preſently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the perfection of others, all is as nothing. But, if by infirmitie any haue fallen, though but in a particular, all his former righteouſneſſe muſt be forgotten, and in the ſinne he hath done, or not done, but is fancied to haue committed, he muſt die to our good opinion.</p>
               <p>Learne wee, to acknowledge and cheriſh by commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the ſmalleſt good things in any; wee know not how we may preuaile to lead on to perfection; it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all men to be led with prayſe: And Gods Spirit tempering himſelfe to our naturall inclination, forgets not<note n="m" place="margin">

               <p>Yet if we conſult with the ſame Apoſtle, firſt, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, the Miniſterie neceſſarie, till ſuch <hi>time as we are made</hi>

               <p>Anſwers to the Argument are thus framed: firſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle muſt be vnderſtood co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paratiuely; not as meaning they had no need of his commonefaction, but not ſuch need, as men auerſe from charitie.

               <p>What is it of Man that ſleepeth?

               </p>
               <p>Wee may perhaps thinke it to be ſome diſaduantage
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:17313:170"/> vnto vs, that wee liued not in the dayes of Apoſtles and Prophets, that taught by ſpeciall Reuelation, and vner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Spirit, what they taught the people of God; but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is it recompenced vnto vs; in that, many of the things which they a farre off beheld in the Prediction, wee with our eyes ſee in the accompliſhment. See it in other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of outward or inward eſtate. Diuerſly hath God ordered the ſtate of his children in this life, calling ſome to teach, ſome to be taught; ſome to rule, ſome to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; giuing ſome, Wealth, Honour, Peace; exerciſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with Pouertie, Infamie, Contempt amongſt men. It is ſtrange to ſee, how emulous wee are one of others preferment in theſe fauours of God; whereas, if wee would rightly weigh it, wee ſhould ſee, that in theſe things, wherein we ſeeme to be caſt behind our brethren, we haue in one kind or other our aduantage of them. Their Wealth is more; ſo are their Diſtractions, and Cares, and Spirituall Dangers; their Reckoning larger at the great Audite and Day of Accompts. Is it not well, the Lord hath freed thee from theſe Diſtractions? made thee rich in Faith, giuen contentment, and dayly experience of his Fatherly care in another kind?</p>
               <p>In that which ſeemes the greateſt diſaduantage, as that the Lord ſo long keepes vs on the racke of an accuſing Conſcience, and with-holds the ſenſe of his fauour, in the pardon of ſinnes, I am deceiued, if there be not ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to the oppreſſed. Vſually ye ſhall ſee the courſe of their liues more ſtrict; ſinnes, that others without ſcruple ſwallow vp, theſe conſcionably flye from; their ſanctitie, for the moſt part, greater; and ſo, I doubt not, ſhall be their glorie. In a word: Is life ſhort? the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is ſpeedier to the Ioyes of Heauen: Is it prolonged? the more occaſion haue they of doing good; their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice greater, and ſo ſhall be their reward. Wee cannot thinke of any diſaduantage of Gods children, wherein they are caſt behind their brethren, but a recompence we
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:17313:170"/> ſhall find in one kind or another plentifully rendred into their boſomes.</p>

               <p>The people thinke it is well with Miniſters, whoſe whole life may be ſpent in meditation of the Word of God; whom God hath choſen to be his Inſtruments to ſaue the ſoules of his people.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond reaſon, is the execution of full vengeance vpon the bodies and ſoules of them, that haue either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly or maliciouſly<note n="i" place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>diſobeyed the Gospel.</hi> And this reaſon is furthered by two others. Firſt, though they now in their ſoules ſuffer what their ſinnes haue deſerued, yet by their bodies, the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their ſoules in ſinning, in the ſame ſtate of ſenceleſneſſe with the bodies of Gods Saints. Its meet therefore, that there ſhould be ſuch a comming of Chriſt, that as bodies and ſoules haue been fellowes in euill doing, ſo they may both partake in the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their abominations. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, moreouer, its
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:17313:172"/> to be conſidered, that howſoeuer the perſonall acts of ſinne in the vngodly, are, as they are acts, tranſient; and ſeene to die with the committers; yet haue many of them a propagation along euen to a thouſand generations. It is ſaid of <hi>Ieroboam, He made Iſrael to ſinne.</hi> It is true, not onely of the time, wherein he liued; but the infection of that policie and example, reached to many ſucceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The ſame is true of other ſins and ſinners; the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſtench of their abominations, continue long after the death of their firſt Authors. Saint <hi>Iude</hi> tells vs of ſome in his time, <hi>that walked in the way of</hi> CAIN, <hi>and</hi> BALAAM. Themſelues were long ſince dead, but the poyſon of their example, remained euen to <hi>Iudes</hi> time, and will doe to the end of the world. And it is not to be doubted, but that all the ſinnes of other men, occaſioned by their example, ſhalbe puniſhed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well as thoſe that in their owne perſons they committed. To the end therefore that they may haue a full meaſure of wrath, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the full meaſure of their ſins; there muſt be a ſecond comming of Chriſt to the vniuerſall Iudgement; and theſe are ſome ends in reſpect of the wicked.</p>
               <p>I might be infinite in ſetting down other ends that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Gods children. As firſt, the <hi>clearing of their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> to the faces of them that haue loaden them with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt ſlanders and accuſations. Secondly, the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing of their labours, that haue not receiued, in this life, any viſible reward.</p>
               <p>And what ſhould I tell you of the vſes it hath in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God himſelfe, and his Chriſt? How often quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell we at the diſpenſations of his prouidence? that hee caſts proſperitie vpon the wicked, and exerciſeth his children with continuall afflictions.

Anſ.</hi> Now, firſt (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) their ground is falſe, their owne hearts being witneſſes, ſaue that they haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut their eyes againſt the light of the Truth: For they cannot be ignorant, that <hi>the Earth once periſhed by Waters,</hi> that Deluge hauing teſtimonie, not onely from <hi>Moſes,</hi> but euen from Heathens themſelues. Beſides, they cannot but acknowledge a ſenſible decay, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of all the creatures from their originall ſtrength
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:17313:174"/> and perfection; we ſee them, as <hi>Dauid,</hi>

                  <hi>waxen old as a garment,</hi> and now, as it were, of their owne accord grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards a diſſolution. Laſtly, that <hi>Word of God,</hi> that was ſo powerfull to giue them a beginning, is it not as mightie to put an end to the creatures? Suppoſe then it were true, that the world ſtands ſtill in the ſtate wherein it was created; the Lord, by whoſe Word and Power it was firſt made, and hath, euer ſince Creation, continued in this order, can with the ſame power of his Word bring it to nothing.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond Argument againſt the Diſſolution, is, as the Epicures againſt the Creation; <hi>Quae machinae?</hi> What ſhould the inſtrument and meanes of Diſſolution be? If we ſay Fire; it is one of the principall parts whereof it conſiſts. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yet can the Lord vſe it as a meanes of the Diſſolution, as he once did Water, the common Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all things, at the vniuerſall Deluge.</p>
               <p>Third Argument, is from the long delay. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> firſt, how much forget they themſelues; meaſuring the dayes of Gods eternitie by the ſcantling of our time? Secondly, how little doe they conſider the ends and reaſons of the delay? which are, not the Lords forgetfulneſſe, or change of his purpoſe, but his patience towards vs, in waiting for our repentance, &amp; the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that number that he hath choſen to life; of whom, perhaps there are many as yet vnborne.</p>
               <p>To theſe of <hi>Peters</hi> mockers, our iudicious Atheiſts, as they would ſeeme, haue added an Argument, as they thinke, irrefragable; taken from the ſeeming neglect of the good and euill done amongſt men.</p>

               <p>Scripture-comforts exceed all others, in three ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, more vniuerſall. Some miſeries there are, for which the Heathen found out, and penned ſome ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low comforts. But how many be there, which they could neuer find ſalue to cure? that miſerie of miſeries, <hi>a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſpirit,</hi> how miſerably do they comfort? No maruell;

               <p>To ſpeake to the point <hi>Paul</hi> here treats of: <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> haue many large Diſcourſes, tending to yeeld comfort in the death of friends. The ſumme of all they ſay, is this, <hi>Eâ lege naſcimur,</hi> Death is ineuitable, none can auoid it; fooliſh therefore for a man to grieue for it. Againe, it is <hi>exitus communis,</hi> none ſcapes it; and here they lay on load, with hiſtories of Cities, Kingdomes, Monarchies, that haue come to ruine. Thirdly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they demurre, whether any thing of Man remaine after death? imagining no other Immortalitie, but in the mouthes of men, by commendation: either they are not, and then are not miſerable; or if they bee, yet herein ſtands their bleſſedneſſe, their ſoules are ridde from the priſon of the bodie. What are the comforts Scriptures affoord in this caſe?<note n="t" place="margin">

               <p>The paſſage to this point is by way of <hi>Prolepſis; q. d.</hi> It may bee inquired, when theſe things ſhall bee. <hi>Sub.</hi> The queſtion is impertinent and needleſſe; in it ſelfe, becauſe the thing is vnreuealed; in reſpect of you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know it ſhall be ſudden.</p>
               <p>The points of obſeruation are theſe: <hi>It is an ancient policie of Satan, to diuert our ſtudies and inquiries from things reuealed and neceſſary, to matters of ſecrecie, and meere curioſitie.</hi> That the Lord ſhall come to Iudgement, is a point reuealed; and of neceſſary vſe to the Church of God; when hee ſhall come, God hath ſecreted to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But mans curioſitie is made vpon ſecrets; in ſtead of meditating, &amp; making vſe of that reuealed, it would be informed <hi>of the times and ſeaſons.</hi> The Diſciples had beene informed of the Lords purpoſe to reſtore the Kingdome to Iſrael; that ſufficeth them not to know; but they muſt be acquainted with the time,<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Wilt thou at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Kingdome to Iſrael?</hi> Of this curioſitie the Apoſtle elſe-where complaines; there were that <hi>doted,</hi> and euen <note n="c" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4.</note> 
                  <hi>languiſhed about queſtions needleſſe,</hi> that had no poſſible determination by the Word of God; no maruell, if they macerate &amp; perplexe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that are intangled therein. In after-times remayned the ſame euill in the Church. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> tels of ſome, that hearing the Doctrine of Creation taught in the Churches of God, left the meditation and holy vſe of that Article of faith, and fell
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:17313:182"/> to buſie inquiries, Where the Lord was, What he did, &amp; How he beſtowed his time, before he made the World. Another ſort, that gaue ſome credence to the Doctrine of Originall ſinne, and could not but acknowledge the deprauation of Nature; but it tortured them to know, how it ſhould be conueyed from <hi>Adam</hi> to his Poſteritie. A fitter inquiry it had beene, ſaith <hi>Austine</hi> in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, or Storie of him fallen into the Ditch, to vſe meanes to come out of it, then to know how wee came into it.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I belong? One of the firſt occaſions of Poperie growing to ſuch height, was this doting about curious queſtions, wherewith their Schoolemen peſtered the World. The Deuill vſed that policie, to diuert mens mindes from things reuealed and neceſſary, ſo long, that they loſt almoſt all truth in the Church of God. It were endleſſe to mention all; take inſtance in that one point of Angels. That there are ſuch heauenly Spirits, and that they are<note n="d" place="margin">

Touching their Orders, what, and how many they were, their number, whether more fell or ſtood: whether they did occupie a place; and ſo, whether many might be in one place at one time; and how many might ſit on a Needles point; and ſix hundred ſuch like need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe points.</p>
               <p>And in this policie, the Deuill is not ſlacke to this day, after we haue ſeene by lamentable experience, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fruits of it. Touching the point of the Text; when the Day of Iudgement ſhall bee, how many haue taken in hand curiouſly to inquire, boldly to determine, not the Age only, but almoſt the Yeere and Day, wherein the Lord ſhall come. And how often heare wee the

Since God hath pleaſed to cauſe the Light of the Goſpell to ſhine cleerely amongſt vs, errours are diſguiſed in the habite

It went once for currant doctrine without diſtinction, that Scriptures might at no hand be permitted to the Laitie: that errour is now refined. And their meaning they ſay is, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly without difference, and without a Catholike Commentarie.

               <p>It were long to mention, how in matters of practice and moralitie, the ſame cunning of Satan may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.

There is nothing more oppoſite to humilitie, then pride: yet how doth pride it ſelfe maske vnder the vizar of humilitie? ſo that it is now taken vp amongſt the differences of pride, there is, they ſay a kind of <hi>humble pride.</hi> Who prouder, or more ambitious then <hi>Abſalom?</hi> who, in outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,

               <p>Thirdly, Flie ſecurity; <hi>he is bleſſed,</hi> ſaith SALOMON, <hi>that feares alwayes;</hi> if any thing ſet thee ſafe from the ſenſe of euill, it is the feare of euill.

               <p>See we what Religion, and reaſon teach, touching death and deſtruction of men. That neither death, nor Iudgement brings with it deſtruction of Nature, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition of being, Scriptures, and Reaſon teach abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.

               <p>What ſhould I tell you of thoſe Arguments, which out of Reaſon Naturalliſts haue drawne? ſhewing of the ſoule, at leaſt; it muſt be immortall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe, they ſay, it hath in it, no principle of corruption, or diſſolution; being incorporeall, &amp; as ſome of them taught, immateriall. At the death of the body they wondered not; for they knew it conſiſted of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Natures; and therefore carried in it principles of its owne diſſolution; but for the ſoule, they thought the originall thereof was Heauenly: made not of any ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie matter, but, if of any, of the Quinteſſence of the Heauens.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Moreouer, they obſerued in the ſoule, a kind of infiniteneſſe of deſiring; which, nothing that this world affoords, was euer able to ſatiate; and that deſire being Naturall, they thought, could not alwayes bee vaine; but ſhould at leaſt after ſeparation from the body, find ſome infinite good thing, in fruition whereof it ſhould find reſt, and full contentment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beſides, they obſerued in the moſt deſperate mainteiners of the ſoules mortality towards death, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable feares, wherewith their conſciences were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. Whence ſhould they grow? from perſwaſion of vtter deſtruction, and aboliſhment? It could not be. For as <hi>Tullie</hi> ſaid; The dead, if they be not, cannot be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. No queſtion therefore, from impreſſion of that principle, faſtened in the hearts of al men; <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, and after that comes Iudgement.</hi> ZENO was wont to ſay, he had rather ſee one Indian, willingly, &amp; of his owne accord go into the fire to be burnt (their cuſtome ſee in <hi>

His meaning was, that the cheerefulnes they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in death, was to him a more binding Argument, that the ſoule was immortal; then all Philoſophical ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:17313:192"/> thinking, there could be in no man ſuch alacritie in death, without a ſtrong impreſſion of immortality. So certainely, the feares that Atheiſts are ſurpriſed withall in death, is an Argument ſtrong as any, that there is a life of the ſoule, after it is ſeuered from the body.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeake of that perfection, time, that weares out all things corruptible, brings to the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule, and vnderſtanding?

And for the other ſort, howſoeuer they ſeeme to like beſt, reproofes, and threatnings of the ſharpeſt; yet if the finger be but poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at their owne ſinnes, none ſo ſenſible, or tender, as they: ſaue that vſuall their skill is ſuch, to turne off all from themſelues to others.</p>
               <p>It would be conſidered, that theſe things are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, not ſo much by times, as by the people, and ſtate of their perſons: looke what is their condition, ſuch muſt bee their portion; of the obſtinate, terrour; of Gods Children, comfort.

               </p>
               <p>From this ſtate of darkeneſſe Gods children are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: <hi>They are not in darkeneſſe. Gods people then, though they be not freed from</hi>

               <p>Groſeneſſe of ignorance thus conceiue: it is partly in reſpect of the things to bee knowne, partly, in reſpect of the manner of knowing.</p>
               <p>The principles of Chriſtian faith are ſo plainely, and familiarly deliuered in Scripture; that euen of a childiſh capacitie, vſing the meanes, they may bee vnderſtood. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them<note n="n" place="margin">

               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:17313:196"/>
               <p>Secondly, there is a kind of accurate, and exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when a man diſtinctly conceiues, not onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities of faith, and practice, but particulars thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing; whereto are required<note n="p" place="margin">

The manner of their diſtinction, as that the Father begets, the Sonne is begotten, the holy Ghoſt proceedes; ſuppoſe particulars belonging to this Article, and requiring a more accurate kind of apprehenſion. He that is ignorant of the manner of diſtinction, is ignorant; hee that is ignorant of their diſtinction, we may ſay, is groſſely ignorant.

We all feele the ſmart of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, in our bodies and ſoules; the earth, and all we put our hands vnto, put vs in mind of our fall in him.

               <p>I beſeech you all, in the Bowels of Chriſt, and as you tender the ſaluation of your ſoules, take notice of it; and labour for knowledge of God in Chriſt.

                  <hi>Had they knowne, they would not haue crucified the Lord of Glorie.</hi> Now ſure, if any be ignorant, it is becauſe they ſhut their eyes againſt the cleare Light of Truth ſhining vnto them: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>If</hi>

                  <hi>our Goſpel be now hid, it is hid to them that periſh;</hi> not through defect of meanes, but through wilfull contempt of knowledge, tendered them in the meanes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As more excuſeleſſe, ſo more ſhameleſſe. He muſt, me thinkes, haue <hi>a brow of Braſſe,</hi> that now liues in any groſſe ſinne, as Drunkenneſſe, Whoredome, &amp;c. So clearely hath the Lord made knowne his Truth, that euen children are able to tell a Sweater, &amp;c. he fearefully offends Gods Maieſtie. Times were perhaps (but thoſe times are paſt) when a man might haue ſwallowed vp many a foule ſinne, without notice of many; ſo groſſe, in former times, was their Ignorance, ſo little their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I thinke it true of many, in many foule ſinnes, <hi>they knew not that they did euill.</hi> But I would faine know, what now are the ſinnes that almoſt Infants cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer: That we may now ſay as the Lord of Iſrael, <hi>They are impudent children, and of a Whores forehead,</hi> that walke in ſuch notorious abominations.</p>

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17313:200"/> our plentie of Knowledge addes much to the weight of our ſinnes. Euery ſinne is now double, to that it was in times of groſſe Ignorance, or leſſe means of Knowledge. <hi>To him</hi>

Gods mercies to Ieruſalem more in euery reſpect; in this eſpecially, their Knowledge, at leaſt, their meanes of Knowledge, farre greater then any vouchſafed to Sodome or Samaria. So may we ſay gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of the times of the New Teſtament; our ſinnes haue this one circumſtance, to adde much to their weight: our Knowledge, at leaſt the meanes of it, are farre greater then any was euer graunted to Fore-fathers, amongſt Iewes or Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Would God we had not too iuſt cauſe to complaine, as the Lord doth of Ieruſalem: that as ſhee had iuſtified Sodome, ſo we ſhall, I ſay, the Iewes; yea, the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; that they, vngracious, and abominable, as they were, yet may well ſeeme righteous, in reſpect of our multitude, now liuing in times of the Goſpel. How o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to them was Drunkenneſſe? To many of them, Whoredome, Vſurie? Euen of vaine Swearing, many made much Conſcience; Periurie they hated, as Hell it ſelfe.

I need not ſay any thing, to expreſſe the nature of it: neither is it my purpoſe to ſhew Fryer-like, all the reſemblances betwixt it and the ſpirituall ſlumber, here forbidden vs. Vnder it the Apoſtle eſpecially ſhadowes out a ſecure ſtate of the Soule, neither fearing God, nor thinking of his Wrath approching nor caring to prepare our ſelues to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with comfort.

               <p>To this end, conſider firſt the vanitie of them all, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any ſpirituall profit; our deſires grow inſatiable by this eſpecially, that wee fancie in them more good then they can poſſibly affoord vs: ſecondly, neither are they vaine only, ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſpeaking from experience, but draw with them in their looſe,<note n="u" place="margin">

               <p>The third dutie followes; Arming our ſelues, as for a Conflict. Of Spirituall Warfare I meane not to treat at large; who ſo would ſee the condition of it, hath at hand the learned Labours of expert Captaines in the Lords Hoaſt. The parts of the Armour here commended to vs,<note place="margin">M. Downham.</note> are <hi>Faith, Hope, and Loue,</hi> the three Theologicall vertues, ſet out by reſemblance; Faith and Loue, in the ſimilitude of a Breſt-plate; Hope, of an Helmet. The vnfolding of the Metaphor is thus: As Souldiers are wont eſpecially to fence their Breſt for the Hearts ſake, the ſeat of life; and the Head, the fountaine and originall of the ſenſes, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe ſafetie depends the ſafetie of the whole Bodie principally: ſo our care ſhould be, againſt the euill day to arme our ſelues with graces beſt ſeruing to ſafegard the ſoule; amongſt which, eminent are Faith, Hope, and Loue, Touching them, two things ſhalbe handled: firſt, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture briefly; ſecondly, their vſe in the ſpirituall combat.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Faith,</hi> thus in groſſe conceiue the nature of it; It is an aſſent to the truth of the Word of God, for the Truths ſake of him that ſpake, and inſpired it. Some principall
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:17313:207"/> reſpect thinke it to haue to the Doctrine of the Goſpel. It is of two ſorts; firſt, generall, whereby we beleeue the Doctrine of the Goſpel in generall; ſecondly, particular, whereby we beleeue it, as true to vs. Of the firſt ſort, yee may conceiue the faith of the Eunuch, being yet a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:<note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 8.37.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Both theſe haue their vſe in Chriſtian Warfare; one laying the ground of Comfort; the other applying it to our ſelues. Temptations yee ſhall ſee aſſaulting in both kinds; the Deuill labouring to make vs Infidels in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that he may make vs incredulous in the particular.</p>

Not much vnlike are thoſe we haue experience of at this day. Thoughts of Atheiſme and Blaſphemie cannot ſtand with grace; no, not though abhorred, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for, ſtriuen againſt.

                  <hi>yet was his heart vpright with the Lord all his dayes.</hi> There be other infirmities, beſides that of ignorance, out of which ſuch omiſſions may proceed. Thus in the generalitie, wee ſee how Faith is oppugned; withall, how neceſſarie Faith, and the right information thereof in the generall, is for comfort. Like thinke we of the particular: for let generall grounds be neuer ſo firmely beleeued, except with like firmeneſſe Faith can aſſume, the Conſcience is all-out as comfortleſſe.</p>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:17313:207"/>
               <p>Euery temptation ſuppoſe to bee a ſecret Syllogiſme. Wherein ſometimes we haue the Propoſition corrupted; after, the Aſſumption aſſaulted; that the Concluſion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not to the comfort of Conſcience.</p>

               <p>We yeeld, they had their priuiledge in the meaſure, and degree of aſſurance; the reaſon is plaine, they had their priuiledge in the meaſure of common euidences, Faith, Loue, Obedience, Sanctity.

Secondly, Is it likely, the Lord denying them the meanes ordinary, would make it ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, to teach by immediate and extraordinary reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Thirdly, It is a wonder to me, this being ſo vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall a grace, it ſhould be taught by none of the Gentiles to their poſteritie; but they ſhould all vaniſh away, in the darknes of their Cogitations. As touching thoſe few Sentences of the <hi>Sibyllae,</hi> extant in <hi>Auguſtine</hi> &amp; <hi>Lactantius;</hi> firſt, neither were they vniuerſally knowne; ſecondly, and were full of obſcuritie and doubtfulneſſe; thirdly, as moſt thinke, not vnderſtood of them that vttered them.</p>
               <p>Leauing theſe Dreames, proceed we to enquire, how and in what ſort Chriſt is means to vs of ſaluation. There is of late ſprung vp in the Church of God an Hereſie, ſtrange to Chriſtian eares, That Chriſt no otherwiſe ſaues vs, then by Doctrine and Example; teaching vs the way to Life, and by his owne practice guiding vs ſo therein, that if we follow his ſteps, we are made partakers of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Me thinks, they thinke of this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> much what as Pelagians of the firſt: As he hurt not his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, otherwiſe then by the poyſon of his euill example; ſo neither doth Chriſt helpe vs, but by his Doctrine and holy Example.</p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:17313:215"/>
               <p>Now, Firſt, It is ſtrange the Lord ſhould ſo farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Sonne, and ſend him downe from Heauen in<note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>the forme of a ſeruant,</hi> for this end only to trace out the way to Heauen, and teach it vnto vs. Sufficiently in all times taught he it to his Church, before euer Chriſt was incarnate, inſpiring the Prophets.</p>

               <p>There is a ſecond opinion, partly Popiſh, placing the mayne of Chriſts mediation in this, that hee merited for vs Grace to fulfill the Law, and ſo to merit ſaluation at Gods hand.

Interpreters think the Metaphor borrowed from the cuſtome of War; wherein euery Souldier hath his ſtation, &amp; is aſſigned to his ranke; from which when he ſwarues, he becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.

               <p>A third ſort are our vagrant and ſturdie Beggers: whoſe baſe and brutiſh life, what termes are ſufficient to expreſſe?

               <p>The third ſort, is of them that <hi>intrude vpon other mens callings;</hi> not ſparing the Function of the Miniſtery, which yet the Lord will haue no <hi>man touch, but hee that is</hi>

               <p>A ſecond ſort there are, not ſticking to diſpute againſt the neceſſitie of this duetie: and to oppoſe principles of Doctrine, againſt precepts of duetie. So ſome write of <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> a Philoſopher; that hee thus reaſoned deſperately againſt this precept of the Holy Ghoſt. Gods prouidence and appointments are immutable; prayer cannot alter them; what he intends to giue, he will giue, though we pray not.

               <p>Fiftly, To account Bleſsings Curſes. Wonderfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour God vouchſafed to Iſrael in their deliuerance from bondage in Egypt; and ſuch as while they felt, <hi>they</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Conſider our no Merits of any the Lords Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yea, our deſeruings of the contrary. Who muſt not ſay, as IACOB,<note n="y" place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, Meditate the miſery of wanting the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> inioyed.

               <p>Thirdly, Set our ſelues apart to ſerious view of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> excellency: there is none of them but haue a ſecret worth in them. Make inſtance, Remiſsion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider the preferment God hath giuen vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in his fauours, aboue many of equall deſerts with our ſelues; which<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> thought no ſmall motiue to thankeſgiuing. See alſo <hi>Exodus</hi> 19. <hi>Deutronomie</hi> 5.3. <hi>Matthew</hi> 13.17.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, Amongſt Gods owne Children thou mayſt perhaps finde ſome, thy inferiours in the meaſures of Grace. I dare ſay there is no man, but may ſay, <hi>God hath in one kind or other made him a ſuperior to his Brethren.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with thoſe behind vs, as it reſtraines Enuy, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokes thankefulneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, Stay not in the inſtrument, by which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueſt Gods fauours. But conſider Gods hand, reaching to thee whatſoeuer good things thou inoyeſt. And of the dutie thus farre.</p>
               <p>The reaſon preſsing it followeth. <hi>For this is the wil of God in Chriſt Ieſus towards you:</hi> that is, It is that the Lord by his Sonne Chriſt hath ſignified to bee his will; and after a ſort the whole, he requires of vs for all the good things he hath done to our ſoules: other Expoſitions there are many, this ſeemes moſt congruous. The obſeruation made to the fourth Chapter and third Verſe, here againe offers it ſelfe: Thither I remit the Reader; wiſhing only wee had all Wiſedome to captiuate our thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt; and not to allow diſputes againſt the ſignifications of Gods will; what the LORD ſpeakes to <hi>Ioſhuah,</hi> ſhould, me thinks, be ſufficient excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to obedience.<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Haue not I commanded thee?</hi> It is that, I am ſure, that formes our obedience to ſinceritie; and chiefly puts difference betwixt the integritie of Gods Children and the formalitie of Hypocrites, and mercenary affection of Hyrelings. Glorious things we find written of Formaliſts; and ſuch, as for ſubſtance of the action, are ſcarce exceeded by the moſt vpright in heart: Yet cannot find teſtimonie giuen to any Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, that hee made the Commandement his motiue. If that were the ground of wel-doing, how is it wee finde them ſo halting in their Obedience? how, that where is the ſame ground of doing, there is not like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance? Hee that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> He that ſaid to IEHV, <hi>Hee

If therefore he deſtroyed <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe the Lord ſo commanded: wherefore departs he not from the ſinne of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> which God had ſo ſeuerely puniſhed by rooting out his poſteritie? <hi>It ſhall euer be the priuiledge of the vpright in heart, to doe what God willeth, therefore becauſe he wills it.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, A third ſort there are, and they are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs; men that vnder pretence of diſcretion, and ſeeing more into the ſtate of Religion then at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance they could ſee, abate of their feruour, and, as they now terme it, violence of gracious affections; ſeeming to conceit, there may be a <hi>nimium</hi> of <hi>deuotion;</hi> men may be ouer-forward and zealous; A Sermon now and then doth well; euery weeks hearing is not ſo neceſſarie; ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Scriptures is good at leiſure times, as it were for recreation; we be not Angels, but Men; and there is a reaſon in all things, euen in religiouſneſſe, if men could hit on it.

Satanicall ſuggeſtions are oft ſubtilly contriued, cunningly coloured; that lying ſpirit ſometimes dares counterfeit the Spirit of truth. Scarce euer was heretique ſo phantaſticall or impudent, but pretended guidance by the Spirit of God. Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, teaching to deſpiſe Authoritie, to vilifie all other ordinances of God, pretend I know not what inſtincts and reuelations from the Spirit of God. <hi>Montanus</hi> tells of a ſtrange Paraclete, that inſpired him; and guided to publiſh his damned errors.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The gift of Prophecie, as of miracles, is now ceaſed in the Church: God deales not now, as in former times, by extraordinary inſtinct or inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His charge is, <hi>To</hi>

But firſt is it a curſed creature, as are Images; or a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſanctified, <hi>as the Arke and Mercie-ſeat?</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Kneele we with opinion of Diuine excellencie dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Sacrament; or with intention to giue it Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip? If not ſo, what ſhew of Idolatry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords the geſture, except what mans vncharitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice fancieth in it? which how much more might haue beene conceiued in the High Prieſts adoration, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Incenſe before the Propitatory?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is it amongſt vs a ſhew of euill? who, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what wee teach againſt the Carnall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, can thinke wee direct our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Sacrament? Let it be therefore at Rome an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous geſture; Amongſt rigid Lutherans a ſhew of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie; In England, who but an Idiot can ſo conceit it? where Elements are taught to admit no change in ſubſtance, but in vſe only by conſecration; where alſo the doctrine of Vbiquitie is reputed a monſtrous Deify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fleſh of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe the geſture to beare ſhew of euill. Is it a dutie to receiue the Sacrament? who may dare violate the veritie of life, to omit an office ſo neceſſary and comfortable, for a ſhew of euill, in a circumſtance connexed with the performance? As if I ſhould aske, who may bee ſo bold as to ſinne againſt God by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dutie, to auoyde a bare ſhew and appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? And of the Precept and ſenſe of it thus farre:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Apply it to reproofe of that venterous and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> headlong reſolution of men, perſwaded the whole care of a Chriſtian for his conuerſation to ſtand in this; that the things he deals withall, be lawful in themſelues, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ill-coloured they are; carrying ſhewes of euill; by circumſtance, poſſibly becomming euill in them.</p>
               <p>To runne with the Drunkard to exceſſe of Ryot,<note place="margin">Example.</note> they thinke vnlawfull; to bee Companions with Drunkards,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:17313:267"/> and of their intimous Familiars, ſeemes warrantable. <hi>Ate not our Sauiour with Publicans and Sinners?</hi> To ioyne with Idolaters in the worſhip of Idols, is thought abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; Friendlieſt conuerſation with Idolaters, what euill implyes it? they may perhaps gaine them to truth of Religion. Pride they proteſt to lothe; but to goe coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attyred, aboue abilitie and calling, the heart being lowly, they thinke may well become women profeſſing the feare of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As if the Apoſtle had ſaid in vaine, <hi>Abſtayne from all appearance of euill.</hi> Secondly, And may not things lawfull, by neglect of due circumſtances, become ſinfull in the doer? To conuerſe with euill men, is not ſimply to all men, in all ſorts ſinfull. Then had our<note n="q" place="margin">

Thirdly, To wound fame at leaſt by this ſhew of euill; occaſioning beholders to cenſure vs as fauourers of their lewd courſes.</p>
               <p>Coſtly and gorgeous attyre is not to all men, at all times vnlawfull. The High Prieſt amongſt Iewes had his Veſtiments of the coſtlyeſt; and our Sauiour blames not SALOMON,<note n="ſ" place="margin">

I cannot oft enough repeate that Canon of <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſo much vſe hath it in the life of a Chriſtian. All our actions and intendements ſhould be preuented with this triple conſideration: Firſt, <hi>An liceat?</hi> Secondly, <hi>An deceat?</hi> Thirdly, <hi>An expediat?</hi> Things lawfull in themſelues may be vnſeemely for our ſtate and calling; vnbehooueful alſo to benefit of others; Thinke vnlawfull for thee, whatſoeuer implyes eyther inexpediencie or <hi>indecorum.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, And muſt the ſhowes of euill be auoyded?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how much more ſhould the euils themſelues bee abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Is the ſhew of Idolatry ſo euill? how much more accurſed is Idolatry it ſelfe? Is it ſo euill to ſeeme coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous? much more to bee ſo, ſeeme wee neuer ſo liberall or religious. Curſed Hypocrites there are many, ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous of nothing but the ſhowes of euill; ſo their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide be painted, no matter how full of rottenneſſe their inwards are. Let them but ſeeme deuout, others ſhall haue leaue to expreſſe the <hi>power and life of Godlineſſe.</hi> Let them not ſeeme prophane; they<note n="t" place="margin">

There is a kind of Libertiniſme coaſting nearer vpon prophaneneſſe, then what the Apoſtle here interdicts vs, and it is much amongſt men. A generation we haue, whoſe whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry is againſt preciſeneſſe, and ſtrict care to flye from euill. Enough they thinke it to ſhunne groſſeſt ſinnes; with leſſer the Lord will beare; It is our too much ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetie once to ſcruple them. Firſt, Let vs conſider, the greateſt appearance and ſhew onely of euill, is leſſe euill, then the leaſt euill that is euill in realtie; yet muſt all ſhewes of euill be auoyded.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To this therefore hath hee added in his Church, his Word and Miniſterie thereof; therein inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all that heare it, to Repentance and Saluation: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſhewing the way and meanes of reconciliation, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> peace with God.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third particle of the concluſion: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Apoſtle prayes the helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the peoples Prayers. In it obſerue, firſt, <hi>Pauls</hi> modeſtie, ſecondly, the peoples duetie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> modeſty, in that being ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an Apoſtle, ſo excellently gifted aboue the ordinary, yet requires the aſſiſtance of the peoples Prayers. Where we may notice, <hi>How men of greateſt gifts, may yet reape comfort by the Prayers of meaneſt Saints.</hi> For which cauſe, is <hi>Pauls</hi> ſo often intreaty of that fauour from Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. See <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.19.</p>
               <p>And if we conſider, Firſt, how impartiall the Lords reſpect is to all his Saints. Secondly, how he delights, to oblige vs each to other in the body of Chriſt. Thirdly, How much hee reioyceth to haue thankes for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, returned from many. Fourthly, what coldneſſe may ouertake the greateſt, when there is feruour in the meaneſt; this will eaſily appeare.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18</note> 
                  <hi>God is rich in mercy to all that call vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> him, in ſinceritie and truth; giues</hi> as ſoone to the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:17313:277"/> meaneſt, as to the greateſt,<note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>without exprobration.</hi> It is an opinion arguing too much ignorance of GODS Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Loue; to thinke Prayers receiue their value, from the excellencie of our Gifts. The cauſe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is no gift in vs; but Firſt, the Mercie and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God. Secondly, The merit and interceſſion of Chriſt; which equally belong to all the Lords people. Neyther may wee thinke the Lord takes pleaſure in fluent ſpeech, or Rhetoricall ornaments of Prayers. <hi>Firmeneſſe of beleeuing, feruencie of affection,</hi> much more pleaſe God, then all other adiuments and helpes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: which may be as great, in men otherwiſe mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifted, as in thoſe, whom, in other indowments, the Lord hath preferred before many.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Beſides, the Lord delights by all meanes to make vs each beholden to other. What <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of the body Naturall, is as true of the Myſticall. <hi>The head cannot ſay to the foote,</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue no neede of thee;</hi> Nor the principall members in Chriſts Body, that are as Hands or Eyes to the Church, to thoſe that are as low as the feete, <hi>I haue no need of you.</hi> So hath God diſpenſed his gifts in all kindes, that euery one hath in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects his preeminence aboue another. Which made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, We <hi>ſhould euery man thinke another</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Non minùs verè quàm humiliter</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> gloſſeth; becauſe in ſome gift or other, at leaſt in the meaſure or vſe, another may be a better to vs. One perhaps prayeth in better termes; another, with more faith to bee heard; a third, with more ſenſe of wants, and ardencie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. If none of theſe, yet may the Lord of purpoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that to the Superiour, which he grants to the Prayer of the Meaner; that by all meanes, hee may cheriſh a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reſpect in the greateſt, towards the meaneſt of his Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Moreouer; It is that the Lord much reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, to <hi>haue the prayſe of his mercie celebrated by the
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:17313:277"/> mouthes of many Saints.</hi> Bleſſings intended to ſingulars, he will haue begged by many, that for the beſtowing he may reape thankes from many. That made <hi>Paul</hi> deſirous to haue his deliuerance obtained by the Prayers of many, <hi>That as it is procured by many</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo thankes may be returned from many to God, the Author of the bleſſing;</hi> whileſt euen in ſingle bleſſings beſtowed on ſingular perſons, many yet may ſee the louing kindneſſe of the Lord, in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Prayers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Finally; The greateſt of Gods Seruants oft feele remiſſeneſſe of their feruour, as in other Offices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, ſo in this of Prayer. The Lord withdrawing the liuely vigour of his Grace; whether to preuent or chaſten Pride; or to correct Ingratitude and Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for what cauſe ſoeuer, The greateſt may obſerue, their deuotions keepe not alwayes the ſame pitch of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; ſometimes proſperitie diſtracteth: ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of anguiſh ouer-chargeth affection; perhaps, as befell <hi>Dauid,</hi> in particulars of groſſe ſinne we are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, to the grieuance of Gods Spirit of Grace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation in the greateſt; whereas in the meaner, where is more feare and humilitie, through conſcience of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, they abide in their ancient vigour. In which caſe, who ſees not how helpfull to the greateſt, the Prayers of the meaneſt may be?</p>
               <p>And it giues iuſt occaſion to notice that curſed policy <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> of the Church of Rome, whereby, as one meanes, they grew firſt to ingroſſe the Reuenewes of Kingdomes, where they once gate footing. It was, pretence of daily Prayers to be made in behalfe of their Benefactors; And that, as they bare people in hand, by men in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace and fauour with GOD; ſuch as their Monkes, &amp;c. men ſequeſtred from all ſecular imployments; and, as was pretended, mortified and euen dead to the World: By which <hi>colour of long Prayers,</hi> as Chriſt ſpake of Phariſes,<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14.</note> 
                  <hi>they deuoured Widdowes houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="576" facs="tcp:17313:278"/>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe them men ſo eminently gifted, aboue the ordinary ranke of Gods people; muſt therefore their Prayers finde more acceptance with God? or might not Prayers of the people, be all out as helpfull to them? The greateſt of Gods Saints may reape comfort by Prayers of the meaneſt; perhaps as much, as they by men of moſt eminent gifts and calling.</p>
               <p>Let vs bee admoniſhed what-euer our gifts be, not to deſpiſe the meaneſt amongſt Gods Saints: There is none ſo meane in the Church of GOD, but may in ſpirituall things bee helpfull vnto vs; eyther by their example; or holy monitions; or experienced conſolations; at leaſt, by their Prayers to God for vs.</p>
               <p>Too ordinary is our baſe eſteeme and contemptuous carriage towards the meaner ranke of Brethren; occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned often by Pride, and ouer-weening conceit of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent gifts; ſometimes by diſparitie of their outward eſtate; though otherwiſe in ſpirituall indowments, they bee no-whit our inferiours. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> obſerued ſuch partialitie, as a fault in his time; and by reaſons, mee thinkes, weightie, labours to reforme it; ſending vs to conſider, Firſt, How <hi>theſe poore of the World God</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>hath choſen,</hi> and in his loue preferred them before many, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Kings and Monarches, in his election to life. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Many of them <hi>he hath made rich in faith;</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with abundance of ſpirituall bleſſings, as it were to make amends for their outward pouertie. Thirdly, Euen theſe he hath made <hi>co-heires with the greateſt of the Kingdome which he hath promiſed.</hi> Fourthly, If no other reaſon, yet this may ſway vs to louing reſpect of them; that by <hi>their Prayers they may bee helpfull vnto vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pray for vs.</hi> Inferences of Papiſts hence are theſe: Firſt, that if without impeachment of Chriſts mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee may craue Prayers of the liuing, why not alſo of Saints departed? Secondly, If the Prayers of Saints liuing compaſſed with infirmities, bee ſo accepted with
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:17313:278"/> God, much more they of Saints glorified. By all meanes, this muſt affoord them one argument, for inuocation of Saints departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But how followes it, that if wee may craue the Prayers of the liuing, then alſo of the dead? For the firſt wee haue Gods Precept, and Promiſe to aſſure vs; Saints practice to warrant that acceptable vnto God; can they ſhew vs the like for inuocation of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed? Secondly, Wee haue meanes to ſignifie, and make knowne to them our deſires; not ſo to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. They tell vs indeed of a Glaſſe of the Trinitie, wherein, by I know not what reflexion, they ſee, belike, whatſoeuer God himſelfe knowes. But, Firſt, no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion find wee in Scripture of ſuch a <hi>ſpeculum Trinitatis.</hi> Secondly, Angels, that<note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>If perhaps they ſay, It is not <hi>ſpeculum naturale,</hi> but <hi>voluntarium;</hi> and ſo exhibits no more then God ſees expedient for them to know: yet muſt they bee able to proue, that theſe are amongſt thoſe expediencies, which the Lord hath reuealed himſelfe willing to make known to his Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what infinite oddes? betwixt requeſting the Sociall helpe of our Brethrens Prayers; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating of bodies and ſoules to Saints departed, out of a ſuppoſed power they haue, to know our hearts; and a conceit of more mercie in them, then in our GOD the<note n="f" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3.</note>

               <p>As touching our Office, Three things eſpecially are pointed at to bee remembred in the peoples Prayers. Firſt, Our abilities. Secondly, Right vſe of abilities. Thirdly, Fruit and ſucceſſe of labours.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To the firſt, I thinke muſt bee referred that of MOSES.<note n="k" place="margin">

               <p>A ſecond particular to bee prayed reſpecting our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is the exerciſe of gifts of Knowledge and Sanctity. In that ſort, that may bee moſt behoouefull for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the beſtower, and benefit of his people. As <hi>Paul;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus many reſpects there are, preſſing on the people as Dutie, Prayer for their Miniſters in regard of their Office. And is this a Dutie?</p>
               <p>How curſed a generation then are wee fallen into? wherein, what ſhould bee prayed as a principall bleſſing of God, is ſo repined at, as if it were ſome heauy plague, or Iudgement God hath ſent vpon the World; <hi>in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs Paſtors after his owne heart to feed vs with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Vnderſtanding?</hi> Firſt, How frequent is that out-cry of the people?

               <pb n="581" facs="tcp:17313:280"/>
               <p>To men ſo eſteeming this bleſſing, I dare ſay, it is, as they eſteeme it; a Curſe, a Plague, a Iudgement; ſent to them only <hi>as a testimony,</hi> to make their diſobedience more inexcuſable; their damnation, more intolerable in the Day of Iudgement. And a day may come, when they may wiſh and wander to heare a Sermon, to eaſe the agonies they are perplexed withall; but ſhall finde no oportunitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another ſort there is of Helliſh people; to whom, in our Miniſterie nothing is ſo great a Corraſiue, as the bleſſing and ſucceſſe GOD in mercie giues it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his people. That which Saints and<note n="u" place="margin">

               <p>Truth is, the Nature of this affection, is, as of fire, it can by no meanes be conceiled, but breakes out, and will find vent.</p>

               <p>And that neereſt loue and teſtimonies thereof ſhould thus bee limited to Saints: euinceth, Firſt, our neereſt coniunction with them in the body of Chriſt, by the bond of the Spirit. There are neighbours in Nature; by Cohabitation: in Affection: in Grace. Beſides that, moſt of theſe proximities may haue place in the Saints of God, how neerely hath the Lord combined vs in the body of Chriſt, vnder one head? and quickned vs by the ſame Spirit? Secondly, though enemies may not be excluded from our loue, yet who makes queſtion, but friends muſt be preferred in the meaſure of louing? To SAVL an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, DAVID <hi>ſhewed kindneſſe.</hi> But his <hi>ſoule</hi>

By their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſpiritual gifts, and holy example, they may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances to vs in the way to life.</p>
               <p>Iuſtifiable therefore againſt all cauils of graceleſſe and malicious men, is this prudence in Charity. Generally, wee ſee men, that moſt hate ſocietie with the Saints of God, are firſt that finde fault with their ſtrangeneſſe in

                  <hi>manners</hi> of the world; but from the friendly ſociety and familiar acquaintance of men of this world. Secondly, And can wee thinke it is for nothing, we are ſo often commanded to beware their companie; leſt <hi>we

               <p>Criminous therefore is partialitie in our affections owards the children of God. It is that which in point of

               <p>The forme or manner is with adiuration; <hi>I adiure you.</hi> The word in common vſe ſignifies one of the two.

<pb n="592" facs="tcp:17313:286"/> teachers.

               <p>Secondly, no maruell, the firſt vſe, and ſecondly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it being ſo great, and behoofefull to the Church of God. Firſt,<note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>For diſcerning things that differ, and triall of Doctrines,</hi> taught by the Teachers; to which end <hi>Eſay</hi> calls to <hi>the Law and Teſtimony.

Secondly, the peoples better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the letter of Scripture, &amp; language of the holy Ghoſt. Which how much auaile brings it to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of what is deliuered by their Teachers?

               <p>Secondly, the power of it is exceeding great. Firſt, to <hi>worke knowledge;</hi> a comfortable meaſure whereof may be by reading attained; ſo hath God in things <hi>neceſſary,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelfe to the<note n="g" place="margin">

Thirdly, yea, often hath it prooued a ſtrong preparatiue to ſauing faith and conuerſion; as to <hi>Austine</hi> was the obeying of that voyce from heauen, <hi>Tolle; lege.</hi> To <hi>Iunius</hi> the reading of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell. Fourthly, A maruellous power it hath to excite &amp; quicken Grace, quelled in the heart; as in <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> the <hi>reading of the Law,</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.20</note>

                  <hi>Godly ſorrow to repentance.</hi> Of ſuch neceſſity, and auaile to Gods people, is the naked reading of Scriptures in the Congregation.</p>
               <p>And it inſtructs vs to beware, how in our Iudgement or practice we vilifie this ſo holy and wholſome an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:17313:286"/> of God. It is as much Gods Ordniance that Scriptures bee read, as that they be interpreted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the people.</p>
               <p>The policie of Satan would here be noticed. Gladly hee would make vs all prophane Anabaptiſts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne all Gods Ordinances. Thereof when hee ſees vs ſcrupulous, ſome one he permits to admire, that the reſt may be deſpicable in our eyes.
